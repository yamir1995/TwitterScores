Title:Has any player ever scored the â€˜perfect dead-ballâ€™ hat-trick? | The Knowledge
Date:2015-04-15
Content:â€œHas any player has scored a â€˜perfect dead-ballâ€™ hat-trick in a game, coming from a free-kick, penalty and straight in from a corner?â€? wondered Rob Yeoman last week. The slightly surprising answer is â€¦ yes! â€œHere in Japan in 2010 the Brazilian midfielder Marcio Richardes achieved the feat while playing for Albirex Niigata against Vegalta Sendai,â€? writes Alastair Bourne. â€œAnd hereâ€™s the evidence to prove it â€¦â€? GOLDEN BOOT PENALTY TAKERS â€œSo I was watching the highlights of the CAF U-20 African Youth Championship semi-final between Nigeria and Ghana,â€? began Tobi Amoo, a couple of weeks ago, â€œand I observed as Musa Muhammed, Nigeriaâ€™s buccaneering right-back and captain, blasted the ball into the net from the penalty spot for the second goal, that would make him the highest scorer at the tournament with four goals, having scored three goals earlier in the group stage, all from the penalty spot. The question is: has a player won the Golden Boot at any tournament, club or country, by scoring only penalties?â€? The slightly surprising answer is â€¦ yes! Again! â€œWell, there is a quite special case, which is the goalkeeper Carlos Fenoy becoming top scorer of a team this way,â€? begins Jordi GÃ³mez (not that one). â€œFenoy was an Argentinian goalkeeper, who arrived to Spain to play for Celta de Vigo in 1976. In the third match of the season, against Real Sociedad, he became a club idol by showing his skills from the penalty spot. First, he saved a penalty taken by Ricardo MuruzÃ¡bal, and later scored another one against the mystical Luis Arconada to give Celta a 1-0 win. During the rest of the season, he managed to score four more penalties, against Real Madrid, Las Palmas (twice), and Elche. In total he scored only five goals, but it turns out that the forwards at Celta that season were not very lucky, so the goalkeeper was the lone top scorer of the team in that league championship. Celta got relegated with a total of only 22 goals for in 34 matches.â€? LONGEST GAP BETWEEN CAPS â€œAs my house mate and I were half watching the Scotland-Northern Ireland game I completely misheard the commentator say that it was some players first appearance in 16 years,â€? writes Jamie Dodd. â€œThis turned out to be false following a quick rewind but it got us thinking â€“ which player has the biggest gap between two international matches and how long was it?â€? The record for the longest gap between two England caps belongs to the Liverpool legend Ian Callaghan, who won his second cap against France in Englandâ€™s final group game of the 1966 World Cup but then had to wait 11 years and 49 days for his third cap, when Ron Greenwood recalled him to face Switzerland in a friendly in 1977. But the world record. Wouter IJzermans reckons it might be the Greek Maradona Vasilis Hatzipanagis. â€œHis first game for Greece was on May 6 1976 (a 1-0 victory over Poland),â€? writes Wouter. â€œAfter his first match Fifa prevented him from playing again for the Greece squad because he had played for the Soviet Olympic team back in 1975 [Hatzipanagis had been born in Tashkent to Greek political refugees]. After a long career, he was offered a chance to play another international match when this restriction was lifted in 1999, which means he got his second cap at the ripe old age of 45 on the December 14 1999 in a friendly match against Ghana (1-1), 23 years after making his debut for the Greek national team.â€? Here he is winning that elusive second cap: And hereâ€™s why itâ€™s such a shame he missed out on so much international football: KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE â€œApparently, some MP mentioned some footballer in the Commons the other day, or something,â€? began Andy Jowett back in 2011. â€œWhat other examples are there of players being mentioned or discussed in the chamber â€“ in any capacity â€“ by the honourable members? I believe questions were asked in parliament when Alf Common moved from Sunderland to Middlesbrough for Â£1,000 but are there any others?â€? Last week we looked at the footballers who have been namechecked in the House of Lords, with Michael Howardâ€™s 1994 World Cup optimism and John Wellsâ€™ 1984 assertion that Glenn Hoddle and Bryan Robson should be the British leaders in the event of an apocalypse particular favourites. But in terms of sheer numbers and, it seems, premeditated action, Stephen Pound deserves special mention. The MP for Ealing North managed to shoehorn an entire Fulham first XI (and a couple of subs) into a debate on the Planning and Energy Bill in May 2008: â€œI thank my hon Friend for the positive way in which he is approaching this excellent Bill. New clause 1 would introduce a requirement to exceed building regulations â€“ a Merton plus, plus model. In view of the work done by experts such as McBride and Healey, is it not the case that the building regulations will always be exceeded, regardless of what they are?â€? â€œMy hon Friend underlines in many ways the importance of this Bill promoted by the hon Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon). However, I am concerned about whether there is a lacuna in the area of education. I think of my constituent, Mr. Simon Davies, who told me about the house built in south Wales by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews), which is known as the â€œTeletubbies houseâ€? and is built almost entirely underground and covered with what he calls organic insulation and the rest of us call grass.â€? â€œMy hon Friend refers principally to thermal insulation, but he is on to something quite important with regard to sound attenuation. On the point about the amount of development in inner-London constituencies, in my area, even where there are cellars â€“ or Kasey Kellers as people call them locally â€“ people have tried to build there. Given his discussions with the Thermal Insulation Manufacturers and Suppliers Association, was he aware of any part of its remit that includes the benign combination of thermal and sound insulation in the same material?â€? â€œI do not think that there will be many arguments in the House today except on points of detail. My hon Friend referred to forward-thinking local authorities. I appreciate that we cannot introduce retrospective legislation, or retrofit legislation, and a builder such as Murphys in my constituency will say that it is perfectly happy and comfortable with the requirements for extensions and new build, but is there not a danger that we could end up with a two-tier system where older converted properties are energy-inefficient and the modern ones are efficient?â€? Bearing in mind your rigid strictures, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will not give the warm words of praise to that eager partnership that I would have given otherwise. My hon Friendâ€™s new clause 1 is permissive: he is saying what a local authority may do, not what it shall do, which is implicit in the Bill as drafted. House prices are falling. If one talks to builders such as Mr. Dempsey in my constituency, to whom I talked last week, they will say that in a falling house market, margins are shaved. I have mentioned former local government planning officers, who seem to work as consultants nowadays. Many of them will be as busy as Jimmy Bullard, as we say in west London, trying to find their way around words such as â€œreasonableâ€? and around the permissive nature of â€œmayâ€?. My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point, which is relevant to home information packs, although I do not wish to rehash the whole argument that we had on those. His point chimes with mine, in that, by and large, we tend to seek examples of good practice that have commercial benefit. I remember visiting a property in a place called Hangeland, in Norway, where they use a commercially driven system of heat insulation, not just because that is environmentally correct, but because it is an advantage to do so in that part of the world. There is no point whatever in having energy-efficient homes if people do not want to live in them or if they cost too much. Prefabs are very popular; Baird Avenue in my constituency was built before the war and it is very popular. Does my hon Friend agree that it matters not whether a person is called Konchesky or Stalteri, and that what matters is the home that they need, not their origins? The hon Gentleman is to be congratulated on the way in which he has promoted the Bill. He has not used some of the more flashy and apocalyptic images. He has been more of a Barrington than a Dexter, more of a Gooch than a Gower and more of an Erik Nevland than a Diomansy Kamara. His taut, sparse, precise, elegant Bill has been all the better for that. For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. Can you help? â€œSince any player born in the decade of Choppers, glam rock and being fondly remembered by Stuart Maconie â€“ that is, the 1970s â€“ would now be a veteran, I was wondering who was the last player active in any of the top four tiers of English football to have been born in the 1960s?â€? wonders James Murton. â€œThe New Saints have won the league cup, the league and are through to the final of the Welsh Cup,â€? writes Seiriol Hughes. â€œThey are unbeaten in all competitions this season so far, and if they avoid defeat in their final three league games and in the cup final, they will create Welsh domestic football history â€“ the first team ever to complete an unbeaten season in all competitions. Is this unprecedented? How many other teams have completed a perfect season in all competitions?â€? â€œIn the recent Concacaf 2018 World Cup qualifiers, St Kitts and Nevis beat Turks and Caicos Islands by 12-4 over two legs, with both matches finishing 6-2,â€? notes Andrew Willimott. â€œHas there ever been a higher aggregate score between two teams over two legs where both matches have featured the same score?â€? â€œLast weekâ€™s Knowledge mentioned Manchester Cityâ€™s Uefa Cup campaign from the 2008-09 season,â€? writes Andrew Thomas. â€œAfter a quick look at their campaign trail, I noticed that including the qualifying round they played three teams from Denmark. Has a team ever played more teams from the same country in a European cup campaign?â€? â€œHibs and Hearts played at the weekend,â€? begins Paul Reilly. â€œHibs are playing in a special all green kit this season (as opposed to the usual white sleeves) and Hearts wore a Argentina inspired away kit rather than the usual maroon. I canâ€™t think of any reason why Hearts would be in their away kit as itâ€™s never occurred before against Hibs (that Iâ€™m aware of) and with Hibs also wearing a different kit than usual this got me thinking. Are there any other examples of derby matches where teams have played in kits that broke with tradition? eg Celtic in a black kit against an all red Rangers, Barcelona in green against a yellow Madrid.â€? â€œHamilton Accies are having a season of two halves: challenging and holding top spot in the Scottish Premiership before Christmas they havenâ€™t won since Alex Neil left to become manager of Norwich, who have since seen their own fortunes change for the good,â€? writes Andrew Tomlinson. â€œMy question is: whatâ€™s the biggest shift in results from before Christmas to after? I remember Villa imploding under Marin Oâ€™Neill, and Everton traditionally failed to play before winter under Moyes. Has anyone been top at Christmas but managed to get relegated?â€? â€œRelegation-haunted Orientâ€™s goal difference is currently only -4,â€? tweets garethjm. â€œAny teams ever gone down with a better goal difference?â€?

Title:Some players do 'ave 'em
Date:2015-04-16
Content:LUIS AND LUIZ Itâ€™s been a magical 12 months of high achievement for the Â£50m-rated footballer David Luiz. Last summer, he embarked on a selfless quest to relieve Brazil of the pain of the Maracanazo, which had nagged away at the national consciousness since the 1950 World Cup. And after performing one simple contemporary dance routine in Belo Horizonte, 64 years of pain were washed away in 29 minutes, as approximately 202,000,000 Brazilians completely forgot about Moacir Barbosa, Alcides Ghiggia et al forever, and started to consider another subject altogether, and in some depth too. Job done! Then there was his goal for Paris Saint-Germain against Chelsea, which he celebrated quite wildly, and no wonder, as he had joined the highly select and illustrious band to have achieved this feat in recent times against the parsimonious Londoners, lining up alongside the likes of Jon Stead, Ahmed Elmohamady and Ben Mee. And then â€¦ well, thatâ€™s about it. But thatâ€™s some top-class success right there! Some real good achieving. But the crazy run of triumph couldnâ€™t last. Something had to give. And last night disaster struck in PSGâ€™s Big Cup quarter-final against Barcelona. David Luiz opted to spend the evening running around with his legs splayed so wide he would make Ian Brown from the Stone Roses look like a ballet dancer mid-pirouette. This bandy opportunity was soon clocked by the wily Luis SuÃ¡rez, who slipped the ball between David Luizâ€™s legs on two separate occasions, each humiliation the precursor to a stunning goal. â€œI had to nutmeg [him] twice because there was nothing else I could do, it was the last option for me,â€? shrugged SuÃ¡rez, a cheeky grin playing across his face, almost as though folk from Uruguay really, really, really get off on making Brazilians look extremely daft. David Luiz can at least take heart from the support he received from his mother, who should have taken a deep breath and shut down the computer, but instead posted the following ramble on Instagram: â€œI have a son and I always will! His head held high, with a ball at his feet. God knows everything! Jesus is fighting for us until this day and yet we still have people who judge! Who are we to judge you! I will always love you after the good games, and even more after those that donâ€™t go well!â€? He will also have been buoyed by the hearty cheer he received from the Parc des Princes faithful, although that, signally, was only heard when he trotted on to the pitch, and not when he left it, two balls and one tail between his legs later. But a cheer is a cheer is a cheer, and itâ€™s probably best to concentrate on the positives regarding this one.

ArsÃ¨ne Wenger is a bit miffed that nobody will be watching Arsenal 4-0 Reading in the FA Cup because it clashes with Chelsea 1-1 Manchester United. â€œSomething should be done about it,â€? he sniffed, as The Fiver pondered how to break the news that the following weekendâ€™s clash with the Blues coincides with Swashbuckle on CBeebies.

Title:Wolfsburg v Napoli: Europa League â€“ as it happened
Date:2015-04-16
Content:9.56pm BST FULL TIME: Wolfsburg 1-4 Napoli â™¬ â™ª â™¯ Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Rafa, happy birthday to yo-ooo-ouuuuuu. â™« â™¬ â™ª â™­ â™ª 9.56pm BST 90 min +3: But itâ€™s been an awful evening for Wolfsburg, who have been nothing short of appalling. Not a great week for German clubs in Europe, after Bayern Munichâ€™s big defeat at Porto in the Champions League. 9.55pm BST 90 min +2: This has been a stunning display by Napoli, who have been thoroughly excellent from back to front, and have made a huge statement here tonight against a side who were fancied to win this tournament. Napoli really want this Europa League title! 9.54pm BST 90 min +1: There will be three added minutes. In the first, a ballâ€™s whipped into the Napoli area by De Bruyne from the right. The excellent Perisic heads down at the far post. The ball nearly falls to Bendtner, but Britos clears, just in time. 9.53pm BST 90 min: Corner for Napoli down the left. A few clever flicks, and suddenly Ghoulam is in space. His lash from 25 yards is deflected high into the air. Benaglio, who has been jittery tonight, makes a song and dance of claiming, but he does so eventually, under pressure from the 5ft 4in Insigne. Dear me. 9.51pm BST 89 min: Sevilla have turned it around against Zenit; from 1-0 down at half-time, theyâ€™re now 2-1 up. Itâ€™s still 1-0 between Kiev and Fiorentina, and goalless between Brugge and Dnipro. 9.50pm BST 88 min: Defiant support from the home fans, who are doing their best to spur the home side on to a crucial second goal. But this game is petering out, with Napoli taking the sting out of proceedings in the professional style. 9.47pm BST 85 min: Another change for Napoli, as the excellent Higuain is replaced by Henrique. 9.46pm BST 83 min: Luis Gustavo tries to Gabbiadini one from 30 yards, but itâ€™s well over the bar. He had Perisic in space down the left, too. And hereâ€™s the thing: for all Napoliâ€™s dominance, a second Wolfsburg goal now would change things considerably, re-introducing the concept of hope into German lives. Updated at 9.46pm BST 9.45pm BST 82 min: This game has turned into a complete nonsense. Gabbiadini, 25 yards out on the left, launches a rising, swerving shot goalwards. It twangs off the crossbar at some velocity, with Benaglio all over the place, totally clueless at whatâ€™s going on. 9.43pm BST GOAL! Wolfsburg 1-4 Napoli (Bendtner 80) Or is the comeback on?!? Perisic bursts down the left wing, reaches the byline - itâ€™s a stunning, determined run - and whips a low ball into the middle, where Bendtner taps home from six yards. Napoli were snoozing there, which will make the birthday boy livid. A small chink of light for the German side. A very small chink of light, admittedly, but itâ€™s something. 9.41pm BST 79 min: This is an absolute thumping. Rafa Benitez is a European genius. Maggio bursts down the right and stands one up in the middle. If Insigne wasnâ€™t 5ft 4ins, heâ€™d be heading that one in. 9.40pm BST GOAL! Wolfsburg 0-4 Napoli (Gabbiadini 77) And with his first touch, the substitute scores! Insigne in acres down the left. He whips the ball to the far post. Gabbiadini rises above Knoche and plants a header down towards the bottom left. The wrong-footed Benaglio slows it down with a desperate swing of his right boot, but the ball apologetically crosses the line anyway. This is a rout. And Napoli deserve this lead. Theyâ€™ve been as brilliant as Wolfsburg have been dreadful. 9.37pm BST 75 min: Hamsik wonâ€™t be getting a hat-trick. Napoliâ€™s two-goal hero instead receives the personal ovation heâ€™s earned, replaced by Gabbiadini. 9.36pm BST 73 min: Both sides are currently giving the very strong impression that they want this match to be over. Both would declare if they could. 9.32pm BST 70 min: Luis Gustavo has a snap shot from a tight angle down the right, fed through by De Bruyne, but Andujar is on hand to block. A great effort, and a great save. After which Guilavogui is hooked, to be replaced by Arnold. Updated at 9.35pm BST 9.31pm BST 69 min: Insigne, 30 yards out down the inside-left channel, sends a swerving shot goalwards. Itâ€™s heading into the right-hand portion of the net, and Benaglio nearly dives past it, going the other way, but adjusts mid-air, Billy the Fish style, and parries. This is getting desperate now. â€œPaul Sturrock a new entry at 3,â€? writes Simon McMahon. â€œPele down to 4.â€? Have you made space for David Narey? 9.29pm BST 66 min: The Wolfsburg Arena is a very quiet place now. It could do with a song. Another verse of Happy Birthday for Rafa, anyone? 9.28pm BST GOAL! Wolfsburg 0-3 Napoli (Hamsik 64) This is all over. Benaglio plays the ball out to Guilavogui, who plays an aimless ball towards the Napoli right wing. Callejon pounces on the piss-poor pass, bursts into the area, and squares for Hamsik, who sidefoots home from six yards. What a farce. Thatâ€™s dreadful defending. 9.26pm BST 64 min: Schurrle, who has been busy if a bit rusty, and unfortunate not to score early doors, is replaced by Perisic. 9.24pm BST 61 min: Wolfsburg just arenâ€™t on their game tonight. Vierinha dawdles in the midfield and is robbed by Higuain down the Napoli left. On another day, Higuain would have found Callejon bursting through the centre, but the ballâ€™s too strong. A real sense that Napoli could strike the killer blow any time. It just needs one more quick break to click. 9.22pm BST 60 min: And now Napoli make a change, swapping Mertens for Insigne. 9.21pm BST 58 min: Wolfsburg make a change, the stunningly ineffective Dost replaced by Bendtner. The former Arsenal striker is nearly in the thick of it immediately, Schurrle heading a long diagonal ball from the left down at the right-hand post. But it doesnâ€™t quite fall to his new strike partner. Napoli hack clear. 9.19pm BST 57 min: Hamsik makes a bit of ground down the right wing. Heâ€™s 40 yards from goal, out by the touchline, and tries to float one over Benaglio and into the top left. That effort is beyond ambitious. And beyond the goal, too, the ball sailing into the stand to the left of goal. But what confidence Napoli are playing with right now. 9.17pm BST 55 min: A few passes in the Napoli half by Wolfsburg. They probe this way and that. Eventually De Bruyne, 30 yards out down the inside-right channel, slips the ball inside to Luis Gustavo, whose long-range blooter is deflected away for a corner. From which, Caligiuri dribbles in from the left, and looks to curl one into the top right. Not quite. But thatâ€™s a whole lot better from the home side, who pushed Napoli back and actually got a couple of efforts away. 9.15pm BST 53 min: Mertens busies himself down near the left-hand corner flag, and squirts clear along the touchline. He finds Higuain, who canâ€™t get a shot away from a tight angle but earns a corner. The set piece results in nowt, but the home side are living extremely dangerously. This quarter final could be over quite soon if they donâ€™t raise their game, and quicksmart. 9.13pm BST 50 min: Schurrle has been busy down this right wing since the restart, making a couple of dangerous runs. Heâ€™s in space again, and fires a low cross towards the near post, where Britos very nearly slices into the top-right corner of his own net. That would have been highly farcical, as he was facing upfield at the time. But he gets away with it, the ball flashing out for a corner, which is wasted. 9.11pm BST 48 min: Napoli should be out of sight. Higuain is sent scampering down the inside-right channel, and again he powers ahead of the thin green line at the back. Heâ€™s free in the area, and looks to slot one into the bottom left, but his effort is blocked wonderfully by the strong hand of Benaglio, who has just kept his side in the Europa League. Updated at 9.12pm BST 9.10pm BST 47 min: Wolfsburg start the half on the front foot, Caligiuri powering down the left and winning a corner, the otherwise excellent Maggio having been caught on the ball upfield. But not for the first time this evening, their set piece delivery is arrant nonsense. Napoli clear, with an insouciant whistle. 9.07pm BST And weâ€™re off again! Napoli get the ball rolling for the second period of this first leg. No changes. Dynamo Kiev are 1-0 up over Fiorentina, incidentally, while Zenit are leading at the holders Sevilla. â€œMaradona has to be the best ever, eh, Scott? With Ralphie Milne a close second. Pele third.â€? Dundee United fan Simon McMahon there. And who could argue with his findings. Updated at 9.07pm BST 9.02pm BST Half-time entertainment: Napoliâ€™s bid for a second Uefa Cup / Europa League is looking good right now. Hereâ€™s a shot of them winning their first and only European trophy back in 1989. Ciro Ferrara skating on the margins of dignity there, his trouser arrangement proudly displayed for all the world to see. Diego doing well to avert his gaze. 1989: Napoliâ€™s greatest hour in Europe Photograph: Bob Thomas/Bob Thomas/Getty Images 8.55pm BST HALF TIME: Wolfsburg 0-2 Napoli So thereâ€™s the form book for you. Wolfsburg the hot team in the Bundesliga, Napoli struggling for goals of late. And look whatâ€™s happened. Wolfsburg can consider themselves unfortunate not to be on the scoresheet, and Napoli certainly got the benefit of the doubt with the handball decision on the first goal. But the Italians deserve their lead. Theyâ€™ve been magnificent. This promises to be quite a second half, because the Germans need something, and Napoli look sharp on the break. No flipping! 8.53pm BST 45 min +1: Schurrleâ€™s luck really is out: he drops a shoulder to cut in from the left and unleashes a rising screamer thatâ€™s heading for the top-left corner. Unfortunately Andujar is its equal, fingertipping the ball onto the crossbar and out for a corner, which proves to be a non-event. So unfortunate for the home side. 8.51pm BST 45 min: Caligiuri embarks on a determined run down the right. He powers into the area, and fizzes a low ball to the near post, where Dost awaits. But Albiol crowds him out, and Andujar gets down quickly to tip the ball away from the scene. On another day, itâ€™d have fallen for Schurrle, rushing in, but it goes behind the striker and is hacked clear of danger by Britos. 8.49pm BST 43 min: Napoli stream forward calmly, Higuain holding the ball in the centre before tipping it to his left for Hamsik, who threads a low shot towards the bottom right. At full stretch, Benaglio tips it round the post with his fingertips. Superlative save, and a clever shot. The corner comes to nothing. 8.48pm BST 42 min: Another free kick for Wolfsburg, this time out on the right. Rodriguez loops it up and down and straight into Anjujarâ€™s arms. Ah well, it cleared the first man I suppose. 8.47pm BST 40 min: Caligiuri cuts in from the left and, on the edge of the box, attempts to whip a curler into the top right. The ball hits the right shoulder of Britos. The home side claim a handball, but for the second time tonight that sort of decision doesnâ€™t go their way. The ref got that right. The ball breaks to Schurrle on the right, and he whips a low ball into the centre, but Andujar is down to smother. 8.45pm BST 39 min: Inler slides into Caligiuri, rather clumsily, and is fortunate to escape a booking. That looked a sore one, right on the ankle. But itâ€™s a free kick to Wolfsburg in a very dangerous position, 35 yards from goal, just to the left of centre. But again De Bruyne fails to beat the first man, with the box loaded! Hopeless. 8.44pm BST 38 min: De Bruyne tries to up the tempo for Wolfsburg, going on a high-speed slalom down the inside-left channel. He beats three men rather deliciously, but heâ€™s got no support, Dost having taken root in the middle of the park. Eventually he loses possession, but that little cameo offered the Wolves some hope. He had Napoli on the back foot there. 8.42pm BST 35 min: Napoli are ripping Wolsburg apart down the flanks. Hamsik is sent scampering into space by a pitching wedge down the right by Maggio. He helps it on to Higuain, who enters the box completely unchallenged, but fortunately for the home side heâ€™s faced with a tight angle. Higuain tries to Van Basten it home, but thatâ€™s wild and wide right. Wolfsburg really need to watch themselves here; their Europa League campaign is on a knife-edge. 8.39pm BST 32 min: Hamsik makes off down the right, reaches the touchline, and pulls one back for Higuain, whose shot from the penalty spot, on the run, is blocked by Naldo, rather brilliantly it must be said. What a block! That would have put this tie to bed, you would have thought. Wolfsburg go up the other end and win a corner, Guilavogui whipping a ball in fro, the right, Albiol powerfully heading behind. But all that occurs at the resulting set piece is a fairly lame Schurrle shot from distance. 8.36pm BST 30 min: Now itâ€™s Wolfsburgâ€™s turn to put a lovely passing move together, De Bruyne drawing a couple of dark blue shirts towards him on the left touchline before flicking a ball into space along the flank for Schurrle, whose low cross is hacked out of play for a corner by Albiol. The set piece is fired into the mixer, where Naldo powers a header towards the top right from 12 yards. Itâ€™s only just over the bar, causing the net to ripple, and fooling some of the home support into celebration. Not this time. But thatâ€™s much better from the home side, who started well only to capitulate in some style. The closest theyâ€™ve come. 8.34pm BST 28 min: A free kick for Wolfsburg down the left. A chance to load the box. The Germans are strong at set pieces - but they canâ€™t do much if the delivery doesnâ€™t beat the first man. De Bruyne has the good grace to look ashamed at his mishit free kick. 8.32pm BST 26 min: Itâ€™s all Napoli now. Theyâ€™re winning every single ball right now. Another corner, this time down the left, comes to nothing. But the home side are now all over the shop, in a total panic, their Europa League challenge in serious bother already. 8.31pm BST WHAT A GREAT GOAL THIS IS! Wolfsburg 0-2 Napoli (Hamsik 23) If there was a doubt about the opener, thereâ€™s no doubt about this one. This is a stunning move. Maggio performs a gorgeous drag-back out by the right touchline to fox Rodriguez. The full back committed, Maggio flicks a ball into the space vacated behind him for Higuain, who romps down the channel before curling a low ball inside. Itâ€™s perfectly weighted for Hamsik, who doesnâ€™t break stride before opening his body and powerfully sidefooting into the bottom right from the edge of the area. As good a goal as youâ€™ll see in Europe all season, and this is shaping up to being a very happy 55th birthday for Rafa Benitez. 8.28pm BST 21 min: A break as Callejon is down taking a little nap. Allâ€™s well, heâ€™s up again soon enough. 8.26pm BST 18 min: Wolfsburg try to respond quickly, De Bruyne zipping into a little space down the left. But he canâ€™t find anyone in the centre. The hosts seem a little shell-shocked by letting in the opening goal. They were well on top before Napoli struck. 8.24pm BST 16 min: Well, what a sucker punch that was. Happy birthday Rafa. And it nearly gets even better, Higuain chasing another long ball, this one down the inside-right channel. He manages to get a scuffed shot away from a tight angle, and it squirts past Benaglio, but itâ€™s not on target, rolling slowly across the front of the six-yard box. Wolfsburg can clear up. 8.23pm BST GOAL! Wolfsburg 0-1 Napoli (Higuain 15) And after all that, the Italians take the lead! And itâ€™s so simple! Mertens finds a little space down the left, as Napoli embark on a quick break. He drops a shoulder and launches a diagonal ball into the middle for Higuain, who chests down as he powers into the box, before flicking the ball into the left-hand side of the net! What a finish! Shades of handball, as he brought that down half with his chest, half with the meat of his upper arm. But he was being shoved in the back by Rodriguez anyway, so itâ€™s six of one, half a dozen of the other. Great goal! Updated at 8.27pm BST 8.19pm BST 13 min: But suddenly Napoli spring into attack, Callejon sashaying down the right before sliding a ball forward for Maggio. The full backâ€™s in the area, but he canâ€™t get a shot away; itâ€™s blocked for a corner thatâ€™s cleared easily enough. But thatâ€™s a little better from Napoli, who have settled into the role of the put-upon away side all right during the opening exchanges. 8.17pm BST 11 min: A second corner of the evening for Wolfsburg, down the left this time, as De Bruyne fires a low ball into the area. Itâ€™s hacked out. The set piece is headed out to Caligiuri, who decides to meet the dropping ball with a spectacular volley. His effort flies into the stand behind the goal at some speed, nowhere near the target. But Napoli are being forced to dig in here. 8.16pm BST 8 min: This is all Wolfsburg right now. Vierinha hoicks a cross into the Napoli box from the right, but itâ€™s way too big. Then another phase of attack, and the busy De Bruyne is trying to work Maggio down the left. He canâ€™t quite get past. And then another phase, and Luis Gustavo has a lash from distance, but itâ€™s easily gathered by Andujar. 8.13pm BST 6 min: A free kick for Wolfsburg now, the best part of 30 yards from goal, level with the right-hand post. De Bruyne eyes it, but Rodriguez is the man who eventually takes it. And itâ€™s a dreadful effort, an attempted curler for the top-right corner thatâ€™s well wide of the target. Andujar ambled across towards that in the half-arsed fashion, having it covered all the way. De Bruyne may well get the next one. 8.11pm BST 5 min: De Bruyne battles for a high ball down the right. He doesnâ€™t win it, Britos getting there first, but no matter, because thatâ€™s a corner for Wolfsburg. The set piece comes to nothing, but this is a strong start by the home side, who are going for Napoli in a fairly roubust fashion. 8.10pm BST 3 min: Vieirinha makes good down the right with a lovely little backheel to himself, creating a bit of space. He whips a high ball into the area, Dost going up with Andujar, causing a little bit of bother. The keeper makes a nine-course tasting menu of claiming the ball, letting it drop near the striker before snaffling it. Thatâ€™s the job successfully done, after a fashion. 8.08pm BST 2 min: Now itâ€™s Napoliâ€™s turn to get a feel of the ball, sweeping it between their defenders. A slow, steady, studied start to the game. And why not, thereâ€™s still a minimum of 178 minutes to go in this tie. 8.07pm BST And weâ€™re off! The home side get the ball rolling and knock it around the back awhile. A rare old atmosphere in the Wolfsburg Arena. 8.06pm BST The teams are out! Wolfsburg, aka the Wolves, are in their green shirts. Napoli - known as the Partenopei, a reference to Parthenope, one of the Sirens of Greek mythology - are in their change strip of darker blue. 7.50pm BST Wolfsburg are the form team in the Bundesliga. Theyâ€™ve amassed more points than even Bayern Munich since the winter break. Napoli meanwhile sit fourth in Serie A, though their goals have dried up a wee bit of late: four blanks drawn in their last six games. But their last outing was a 3-0 hammering of Fiorentina, so perhaps theyâ€™re coming good at the right time. The Scotland manager Gordon Strachan has just likened their star striker Gonzalo Higuain to John Hartson, for his ability to hold up the ball and bring other players into the game. Some will no doubt laugh it up, but Hartson was a magnificent striker, one of the reasons Celtic made it all the way to the final in 2003. The poor guy was injured for the big game against Porto; Celtic missed him. 7.40pm BST So the road to Warsaw begins in earnest here. No British sides have made it this far, of course, though Celtic, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and especially Everton gave it their best shots. Next year maybe. Itâ€™d be about that time. Only two winners from these shores since Spurs lifted the thing in 1984: Liverpool in 2001, Chelsea in 2013. But this oneâ€™s about Germany and Italy, two countries with even worse recent records in this competition than the English. Parma, poor jiggered Parma, are the last Italian club to lift this trophy; they beat Marseille in 1999. The Germans have been enduring an even longer wait: Schalke were their last heroes in this competition, doing for Roy Hodgsonâ€™s Internazionale in 1997. Itâ€™s been an awfully long time. 7.17pm BST You will be watching ... Verein fÃ¼r LeibesÃ¼bungen Wolfsburg e.

He divides opinion more than he should, given only Nereo Rocco, Giovanni Trapattoni, Bob Paisley and Sir Alex Ferguson have won more major European prizes. Heâ€™s got a Champions League, a Uefa Cup and a Europa League to his name, the trophies won at three separate clubs. This competitionâ€™s been good to him; if Napoli go on to win it this season, heâ€™ll match Trap by becoming only the second man to win it for a third time. Blow your candles out, Rafa, make a wish. This competitionâ€™s been good to Napoli, too. The Uefa Cup is the only European trophy theyâ€™ve won, Diego Maradona inspiring his side to victory against a Stuttgart team featuring Jurgen Klinsmann back in 1989. Theyâ€™re doing a fine job in this campaign, too. Theyâ€™ve conceded the fewest goals of the sides that started in the group stages, just four, an average of 0.4 per game. How very Rafa. But theyâ€™ve also had the most shots on (77) and off target (67), have hit the post eight times, and boast the leading remaining goalscorer in the competition in Gonzalo Higuain, who has six goals. Wolfsburg are, by comparison, relatively inexperienced on the European stage. Theyâ€™ve only played 60 games in Uefa club competition; this campaign matches their best-ever run in Europe, when they lost to Roy Hodgsonâ€™s Fulham in the 2010 Europa League quarter finals. But then this is Napoliâ€™s first appearance in a European quarter final since their 1989 win; Dieter Heckingâ€™s exciting side, currently second in the Bundesliga, have won their last two European home fixtures by two goals; and theyâ€™ve thrashed Napoliâ€™s Serie A colleagues Internazionale 5-2 to get here. So this oneâ€™s in the balance all right. It promises to be a cracker. Itâ€™s on! Kick off: 8.05pm in the UK, 9.05pm at the VfL Wolfsburg Arena, and 9.05pm back in Naples.
Title:Arsenal FA Cup semi-final overshadowed, says Readingâ€™s Steve Clarke
Date:2015-04-15
Content:The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, has suggested football authorities are not doing enough to protect the status of the FA Cup and are diluting its appeal by allowing his teamâ€™s semi-final with Arsenal to clash with the televised Premier League match between Chelsea and Manchester United. Readingâ€™s first FA Cup semi-final appearance for 88 years kicks off at Wembley at 5.20pm on Saturday, 10 minutes before the start of the match between United and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Clarke criticised the scheduling and with Reading having been forced to play last monthâ€™s sixth-round replay against Bradford City on a Monday evening a mere two days after a Championship match at Watford, the manager thinks the FA Cup is not being treated as the worldâ€™s oldest knockout competition that he believes it to be. â€œI thought it was a shame in the last round when we had to play on a Monday night after playing on a Saturday,â€? Clarke said. â€œThere are things that we should do to protect this great competition. It should be special.â€? Clarke also wondered about the logic of holding the FA Cup final more than three weeks after the end of the regular Championship season, meaning that if his team spring a shock against Arsenal they will face a lengthy spell without competitive action before a final against Liverpool or Aston Villa, whose league campaigns end a week after Readingâ€™s. â€œWhen we beat Arsenal we have to wait four weeks after our last league game to play the cup final. This is also not correct,â€? said Clarke, who quipped that his use of â€œwhenâ€? was â€œnot a slip of the tongueâ€?. He was serious when he said that having to wait so long for the final would pose a challenges as to how to keep his players match-sharp. â€œI probably need to go on holiday for two [weeks] and then bring the team back in,â€? he said. â€œItâ€™s a long break. If we get to the final, what are we going to do from 2 May to 24 May? What do we do? Everyone else has played, so we wonâ€™t be playing games. Itâ€™d be a great puzzle to have though. While Clarke lamented the fact neutral TV viewers will have to choose between watching Reading take on Arsenal or Chelsea entertain Manchester United, he is happy fans of his own club will get to see something that most of them have never witnessed. The teamâ€™s last appearance at this stage of the competition dates back to 1927, when they lost 3-0 to Cardiff City, who famously went on to beat Arsenal in the final. â€œThere will be 31,000 Reading fans at the stadium and any Reading fan who has not got a ticket will be watching Reading on television,â€? Clarke said. â€œThe only game Iâ€™m interested in is Reading v Arsenal.â€?
Title:Football transfer rumours: Radamel Falcao to Liverpool?
Date:2015-04-16
Content:Another day, another round of stories about Mario Balotelli leaving Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers has had enough of the Italianâ€™s sluggish play and lack of movement up front. He wants Radamel Falcao there instead. Erm. Chelsea want to turn themselves into AtlÃ©tico Madrid and will continue that transformation by signing Diego GodÃ­n. JosÃ© Mourinho has also been very impressed with Enner Valenciaâ€™s astonishing haul of five goals for West Ham this season, so much so that he wants to buy him and sell Oscar to Juventus. Valencia will start six league games for Chelsea, scoring the fourth goal in a 4-1 win over Aston Villa in September, and will be loaned to Besiktas in January. So Valencia might want to think twice about leaving West Ham, not least because they have identified their next manager: Swanseaâ€™s Garry Monk. You thought it was going to be JÃ¼rgen Klopp, didnâ€™t you? Well itâ€™s not going to be JÃ¼rgen Klopp. He might be going to Manchester City, although theyâ€™re umming and aahing about whether they should hire him, not that it really matters given that the German is probably just going to end up at Real Madrid anyway. Ilkay Gundogan could also be on his way out of Borussia Dortmund. City like the cut of his jib. Manchester United also like the cut of Gundoganâ€™s jib, but they have other priorities, namely Burnleyâ€™s Danny Ings and Southamptonâ€™s Nathaniel Clyne, theirs for Â£17m. Southampton will make themselves feel better about losing Clyne by signing Matt Phillips from Queens Park Rangers. Arsenal have been told that they will have to give James Milner, 29, a four-year deal if they want to sign him, so that should be the last we hear of that rumour.
Title:So why wonâ€™t Manchester City go for JÃ¼rgen Klopp as their manager? | Jamie Jackson
Date:2015-04-15
Content:As the manager who led Borussia Dortmund to successive Bundesliga titles and a Champions League final, JÃ¼rgen Klopp is surely worthy of consideration as Manchester City ponder their next move. Except, for the moment at least, he is not thought to be so. The information from the Etihad Stadium is that any links made between the champions and Klopp should be ignored. Yet here the people who run the club may be passing over a prime candidate to lead a team whose holy grail is the Champions League and which views the first-team manager as vital to its inclusive ethos. When Klopp leaves Dortmund he will have spent seven years building them into a club with a production line of home-reared stars who include Mario GÃ¶tze and Marco Reus. This ticks the box marked â€œholisticâ€?. To beat Bayern Munichâ€™s financial muscle and twice win the German championship means City can also have no doubt of Kloppâ€™s status as an A-list manager. And in steering Dortmund to the European Cup final two years ago, where they lost 2-1 to Arjen Robbenâ€™s late goal for Bayern, Klopp proved his ability to mix it with the continental elite. Related: Farewell JÃ¼rgen: how Klopp became a legend among Borussia Dortmund fans | Andy Brassell This last quality would seem the most attractive to City given the failure by the Abu Dhabi hierarchy, led by the chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, to locate a coach with the managerial nous to lead the club to Champions League glory. Five years into the Sheikh Mansour project and Cityâ€™s progress in the competition has stalled. After Roberto Mancini was twice unable to take the club from the group stage, Pellegrini has guided City into the last 16 in consecutive campaigns and then run out of ideas. In the departments of tactics and motivation, the Chilean appeared a busted flush. These two areas have never been an issue for Klopp. If next termâ€™s XI should include Sergio AgÃ¼ero, David Silva, Joe Hart and Vincent Kompany plus an injection of hungry young star players â€“ Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley and Kevin De Bruyne are all of interest â€“ Klopp would seriously fancy his chances of taking City into the quarter-finals, at least. If Pellegrini is sacked â€“ and there is no guarantee this will happen â€“ City are also cool on Real Madridâ€™s Carlo Ancelotti, AtlÃ©tico Madridâ€™s Diego Simone and Napoliâ€™s Rafael BenÃ­tez as his replacement. But unlike with Klopp, the prevailing reason is the view at the Etihad that none of these men produce sides that play cultured football. Klopp, though, does, as his teams like to press high, recycle the ball quickly and move forward at pace. So, if not Klopp, why not? City may be holding out for Bayernâ€™s Pep Guardiola, though he appears unavailable until the summer of 2016 after stating the wish to serve all three years of his contract. City may also hope that Guardiola could yet come on the market this close season, maybe if a serious meltdown occurs in the Champions League â€“ Bayern play Porto on Wednesday evening in the quarter-final first leg â€“or if relations between the Spaniard and the Bayern executive cool. This all, though, seems a rather tenuous strategy to adopt. Perhaps the human angle is the true, defining factor. Two years ago, Pellegrini was hired as the antidote to Mancini, who was disliked behind the scenes and who thought nothing of clashing with his nominal bosses, the chief executive, Ferran Soriano, and the sporting director, Txiki Begiristain. Klopp is more Mancini than Pellegrini. He would fit instantly into the Premier League cabaret of managers who are the prime media attraction in this age of player inscrutability. But as a maverick coach who oozes charisma and who can occasionally veer off-message, the excitable German just may not fit the Abu Dhabi vision of the man who should replace the Chilean, despite Kloppâ€™s impressive track record.
Title:Farewell JÃ¼rgen: how Klopp became a legend among Borussia Dortmund fans | Andy Brassell
Date:2015-04-16
Content:JÃ¼rgen Klopp may be open about his love of heavy metal but his recent demeanour on the touchline has tended instead to recall a vintage morsel of the Smiths, I Know Itâ€™s Over. Saturdayâ€™s heated exchange with his captain, Sebastian Kehl, a tactical disagreement in the closing stages of Borussia Dortmundâ€™s defeat at Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach, will now be seen as the natural coda to a season in which a bemused frown replaced the rock starâ€™s scissor jump as the coachâ€™s expression of choice. We should remember Kloppâ€™s tenure at the Westfalen in the light of the latter, rather than the former. The famous stadiumâ€™s teeming SÃ¼dtribÃ¼ne â€“ the Yellow Wall â€“ will certainly not allow this seasonâ€™s disappointments to cloud their overall image of the man who brought their vanquished team back to the pinnacle at home and in Europe. Klopp did more than relight the imagination of Dortmundâ€™s fans. He catapulted them above the clouds of their wildest dreams and all the way to heaven. When assessing the entirety of his Dortmund reign, it will always come back to the Bundesliga title wins he authored in 2011 and 2012, with a gleeful 5-2 spanking of Bayern Munich in the German Cup final in Berlin completing a double in the second season. That was a heady day but so was pretty much every one in that two-year spell. After the club almost went bankrupt in March 2005, seeing their team back at the top was not just fun for the faithful â€“ it was staggering. This is why, when Dortmund began to struggle badly in autumn, the outside worldâ€™s sense that the club and Klopp were in crisis was not wholly shared locally. It had been a thousand times worse before. Related: JÃ¼rgen Klopp: â€˜Iâ€˜m not taking a sabbatical. I was no longer the perfect coach for Dortmundâ€™ Less quantifiable, but as important, was the joy the coach spread. That huge smile, the fist pumps in the technical area and those bear hugs for his players came to epitomise BVBâ€™s youthful energy as much as Mats Hummelsâ€™ sorties out of defence, Mario GÃ¶tzeâ€™s jinking runs or Nuri Sahinâ€™s raking passes. The commitment and audaciousness on the pitch seemed like a logical extension of their mentorâ€™s personality. When the former Dortmund midfielder Kevinâ€‘Prince Boateng joined their local rivals Schalke in August 2013, Klopp sent him a text message asking â€œWhy Schalke????????â€? (â€œWith eight question marks,â€? he added for emphasis when telling the story himself, always a keen raconteur). It was a fanâ€™s response, because that is exactly what he had become. When he arrived at Dortmund in 2008, he thought he had the basic structure to build something interesting but he did not anticipate â€œfalling in loveâ€? quite as hard as he did, especially after the wrench of finally leaving Mainz after 19 yearsâ€™ service as player and coach. In November 2013, shortly after signing a contract extension to 2018 and just before a Champions League meeting with Arsenal, Klopp evocatively described the feeling of coming out of the tunnel at Signal Iduna Park as like being born and seeing for the first time. â€œYou come out and you see the best of the world,â€? he marvelled. Kloppâ€™s magnetism had also boosted Dortmundâ€™s renewed international profile. It was something the club were quick to pick up on, running with widespread enthusiasm for their revival â€“ especially around the 2013 Champions League final â€“ and almost packaging their niceness, with the coach as the demonstrative face of it. That smile was seen a little less often this season. Klopp had ridden out tough moments before, notably finding out GÃ¶tze would be joining Bayern days before the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid, but this campaign has been a conveyer belt of bad news, pratfalls and wrong turns. It all started by conceding the quickest goal in Bundesliga history, to Bayer Leverkusenâ€™s Karim Bellarabi after nine seconds of the seasonâ€™s opening game, and it went downhill from there. Despite Robert Lewandowskiâ€™s exit, most still believed that Klopp had the second-best squad in Germany at his disposal. What he did not appear to have was the answers. The gulf between miserable domestic form and still-dazzling European displays was stark. Champions League opponents played on the front foot and allowed Dortmund to counter with pace. Bundesliga adversaries â€“ including modest ones such as Hamburg and Hannover â€“ have sat and defied BVB to break them down, which they have consistently lacked the guile to do. Klopp knew he needed a plan B at the start of the season but a 4-4-2 concocted with Marco Reus at the tip of a midfield diamond ran aground when Reus picked up an ankle injury in the second game of the season, sidelining him for two months. Related: Manchester City cool on JÃ¼rgen Klopp despite Manuel Pellegriniâ€™s struggles Worse still is that plan A has not looked too clever either. Dortmund have often lacked their previous intensity, making one wonder if Kloppâ€™s words are still gettingÂ through. The faults that undermined last seasonâ€™s efforts â€“ missing multiple chances and ceding cheap goals â€“ have only escalated despite the return from injury of key performers such as Neven Subotic. Most damning is that expensive signings such as Ciro Immobile and Adrian Ramos are not in Kloppâ€™s XI of choice. Spending substantial sums wisely is a challenge Klopp is likely to face again in his next posting, which will almost certainly be in England. It is, by his own admission, the most logical choice for reasons of the heart as much as linguistic ones â€“ even if a Paris Saint-Germain approach cannot be completely ruled out depending on how their season ends. The adrenaline of English football is made for Klopp. Manchester City would be a steep if fascinating challenge, while ArsÃ¨ne Wenger does not look like stepping aside at Arsenal just yet. A sabbatical, theoretically, would work wonders for his freshness and his reputation. Pep Guardiola and Kloppâ€™s own possible replacement, Thomas Tuchel, saw their value inflate further during a year off. The question is whether Klopp can sit still for that long. According to him, he was passed over for the Hamburg job in favour of Martin Jol in 2008 after wearing a tracksuit to the interview. The enduring magic of his reign at Dortmund means he could probably wear shorts for his next one.

Title:Newport Countyâ€™s Chris Zebroski jailed on charges of robbery and assault
Date:2015-04-17
Content:The Newport County striker Chris Zebroski has been jailed for four years after admitting four charges of robbery, attempted robbery and assault. Swindon crown court was told that the 28-year-old crashed his BMW into a taxi in December and attacked another taxi driver who filmed him, smashing his mobile phone. He then chased the first taxi driver, pushed him to the ground and punched him at least 10 times, saying â€œgive me your phoneâ€?. Zebroski, who was a youth player for Swindon and has played for Plymouth Argyle, Millwall, Bristol Rovers and Cheltenham Town, said later he was â€œa bit over the limitâ€?. The court heard that while on bail, Zebroski then attacked and tried to rob two men in Swindon after leaving a party. The player was said to have previous convictions for assault and alcohol-related incidents. The Recorder Ian Lawrie said: â€œWhatever talent you had as a footballer has been squandered because of alcohol abuse. â€œIt is a matter of regret if this sentence shatters your professional football career.â€? Zebroski joined Newport, currently ninth in League Two, from non-league Eastleigh in 2013 and was their top scorer last season with 13 goals. Newport later put out a statement saying they had terminated Zebroskiâ€™s contract. â€œNewport County have noted the prison sentence handed down to striker Chris Zebroski today,â€? the club website said. â€œThe club have always had the welfare and wellbeing of Chris at heart and have worked hard with Chris and the PFA throughout. â€œHowever, we would like to make it clear that we do not condone any of the actions for which Zebroski has been found guilty. â€œRegrettably, the club are left with no other option than to terminate Chrisâ€™s contract.â€?

Content:Pep Guardiola has said the fact that four members of Bayernâ€™s medical team walked out on Thursday night changes nothing at the club and that he will remain in charge next season. The famous â€“ and influential â€“ club doctor Hans-Wilhelm MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt quit his job after allegedly being blamed for the teamâ€™s 3-1 defeat at Porto in the Champions League quarter-final first leg on Wednesday night. In a statement, MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt said: â€œFor unexplained reasons, it was the medical department that was chiefly blamed for the defeat. The relationship of trust has been permanently damaged.â€? Related: Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt quits after argument The 72-year-old, who has worked at Bayern since 1977 and was followed out of the door by his son, Kilian, as well as Peter Ueblacker and Lutz HÃ¤nsel, refused to comment further on Friday when pressed on why he had resigned, saying: â€œToday is not the day, it is too soon.â€? Guardiola, meanwhile, said in his press conference on Friday that he respected MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrtâ€™s decision and claimed that it was business as usual at the league leaders. â€œThis changes nothing. I will be here next season and coach this team. It is lovely here. â€œI respect MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrtâ€™s decision and that is all I can say. When a player is injured then it is not the fault of the doctor. Injured is injured. We could have lost against Porto even if we had had the injured players available. No one can guarantee that we would have won with our best XI. â€œWe lost because of Pep, as simple as that. When we lose it is my fault. Not someone from the board or the medical team. It is my fault and my fault only.â€? Guardiola was also forced to comment on a Vine that circulated on Thursday night, from the recent game against Bayer Leverkusen, claiming to show the Spaniard sarcastically applauding MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt after a Bayern player had got injured. â€œThat was just me being disappointed. It had nothing to do with MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt,â€? he said.

Last season, MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt reportedly had a disagreement with Guardiola over the treatment of the injured Thiago AlcÃ¢ntara. Bayern were missing several key players against Porto, including Franck RibÃ©ry, Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Javi MartÃ­nez and Medhi Benatia. They said they â€œregretfully took noteâ€? of MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrtâ€™s decision.
Title:How Wayne Rooney saw off Robin van Persieâ€™s Manchester United challenge | Amy Lawrence
Date:2015-04-17
Content:Quite apart from the jaw-dropping audacity of the goal, and the electric charge it gave the World Cup on day two in Brazil last summer as Holland began to demolish Spain, there was unmissable significance for anyone of a Manchester United persuasion when Robin van Persie took off to score his diving header. Here was a gift to all the amateur body language experts out there. What did Van Persie do next? What was his immediate reaction to this euphoric moment? He sprinted half the length of the pitch, making an unstoppable beeline towards his manager. Louis van Gaal beamed in wait for the joyous high five. It did not require much imagination at that point to observe the regard player and manager had for one another (Van Gaal had appointed Van Persie as Hollandâ€™s captain), to witness the shared ideas and ability to express them, and to come to the conclusion that the connection would be a foundation stone for what Van Gaal hoped to do at Old Trafford. With Van Gaalâ€™s force of personality walking through the door in Manchester, and the deep roots of his rapport with Van Persie already in place, the Wayne Rooney question was always going to be an interesting one. A wager at that time about which of the United forwards might be the most prominent this season would probably have favoured Van Persie over Rooney. So much for probability. Whereas Rooney has become a central figure in the United team redesigned by Van Gaal, it is Van Persie who must now be wondering quite where he fits into Unitedâ€™s gameplan. With his contract soon to tilt into its final year, and his 32nd birthday approaching this summer, his future is ambivalent. Related: Ten things to look out for in this weekend's football | Nick Ames and Paul Doyle Rooney is a player who thrives on being the main man. That provides the platform for this muscular bundle of attacking determination to strut his best stuff. During his 11 years at Manchester United there have been spells on the periphery, skirting behind or to the side of his favoured role on centre stage. He can play the part of the support man, pinging passes to another striker. He has served his time glancing over from wide or deep to see someone else wearing the man-of-the-moment mantle (or at the very least sharing it). But for him, there has never been much comparison between second fiddle and lead guitar. Ruud van Nistelrooy, Dimitar Berbatov, Cristiano Ronaldo, Van Persie â€“ Rooney doesnâ€™t give the impression he cherishes anybodyâ€™s shade. At his most frustrated he has angled (politically in any case) for transfers. Occasionally he has challenged his manager. Who could forget how he became a peculiar sideshow to Sir Alex Fergusonâ€™s farewell match, a brooding figure left out of the squad and watching from an executive box after Ferguson took a dim view of Rooney supposedly wanting out? Ultimately, though, he has an astonishing capacity to push his way back to the fulcrum. Back in August, in pre-season, with the United captaincy up for grabs following the departure of Nemanja Vidic, Van Persie was a clear contender having responded so well to the job under Van Gaal for his country. With Manchester United bringing in Radamel Falcao and Ã?ngel Di MarÃ­a to increase competition for the attacking berths, it was only natural to wonder how Rooney might be feeling about this new chapter. It was a clever move of Van Gaalâ€™s to award the captaincy to Rooney. â€œWayne has shown a great attitude to everything he does,â€? enthused Van Gaal by way of explanation. In the same month Roy Hodgson trusted Rooney with the armband for England. Both managers have since praised the new sense of maturity in him. Rooney comes out of this transitional season in credit. He has sacrificed his preferred game at times, and has once again become fundamental as the colour has returned to United. Inspiring form, goals and leadership have grown in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Van Persie is left wondering what becomes of his United status. This season has not been a particularly happy one for the Dutchman. Post-World Cup fatigue, niggly fitness and form, and the tricky period of experimentation at United during Van Gaalâ€™s first few months decreased his effectiveness. He has been out injured for the past two months. Related: Chelseaâ€™s Eden Hazard not the standout Player of the Year of recent seasons Now more or less ready to challenge for a recall, it is by no means a certainty he will walk back into a United team who have found their balance and sense of collective purpose. Goal-wise, Rooney and Van Persie remain on a similar scale in the Premier League this term (Rooney has 12 from 28 appearances and Van Persie 10 from 24), but the Dutchman may find that only limited opportunities knock for him during the final six games of the season. His sights may be set on a return to the position of his youth, playing off the main striker, but Marouane Fellaini has pressed a convincing case to cause damage from that area lately, and the crafted technique of Juan Mata has become a smart weapon. When Van Persie joined United in 2012, and enjoyed an explosive season which quickly won over the hearts of the support base and culminated in a gorgeous volley to effectively secure the league title, Rooney was at times quite grumpy to be shunted into the Dutchmanâ€™s shadows. It shouldnâ€™t be lost that it was Rooneyâ€™s spectacular pass that created that Van Persie goal against Aston Villa. But this street-fighting footballer has worked his way back to the forefront of Unitedâ€™s ambitions.
Title:JosÃ© Mourinhoâ€™s message from the top is keep calm and carry on
Date:2015-04-17
Content:Title races are supposed to leave even elite managers frazzled. The pressure tends to tell over the run-in, Sir Alex Fergusonâ€™s infamous â€œsqueaky bum timeâ€? rendering the most experienced figures diminished in their dugouts as they sense the chasing pack closing in at pace and their lead being whittled away. So, with that in mind, JosÃ© Mourinhoâ€™s mood on the eve of the visit of resurgent Manchester United to south-west London provided a fair barometer of the anxiety gripping at Chelsea. There was sympathy with the complaints voiced by Steve Clarke and ArsÃ¨ne Wenger over the clash between Saturdayâ€™s FA Cup semi-final and the most enticing Premier League game of the weekend, and bemusement at the maelstrom embroiling the champions, Manchester City. He even joked about match delegates spending too much time eating their â€œsushi and lobsterâ€? and supping â€œfine Champagne, Cristalâ€? in the lounges at Stamford Bridge. â€œThey donâ€™t see the games but just stay eating and drinking,â€? he offered through a broad grin when attempting to explain how his side had been ranked worst in the division when it came to respect for the officials. â€œWe should feed them bread and water.â€? All was calm, utterly at ease, almost jolly. Contrast that with the atmosphere a year ago when Mourinho, his mood darkened by a succession of Football Association disciplinary charges and a cramped fixture schedule with a Champions League semi-final still to come, had dispatched his assistant Steve Holland to conduct the media briefing before the visit of bottom-placed Sunderland. Chelsea would have been top with three to play had they won that game. Instead they surrendered the managerâ€™s 77-game unbeaten home record in the division and were effectively jettisoned from the title race, with Mourinho and his staff left livid by the officials. There would be further sanctions for their snarled reaction later in the month. A year on and all is very much more relaxed. The leaders have lost their top scorer, Diego Costa, to another hamstring injury and his back-up LoÃ¯c RÃ©my to a calf strain â€“ with Dominic Solanke, 17, on the bench instead â€“ but Chelsea are seven points clear of Arsenal and eight of United with a game in hand on each. The message being transmitted from Cobham was that, for all they care, the pressure can fester elsewhere. The closest rivals in the pursuit await in the leadersâ€™ next two matches, Saturdayâ€™s visit of a United side who have won their past six league games being followed by a trip to an Arsenal team who are on a run of eight straight victories, but the onus is on those playing catch-up to make this race properly interesting. â€œI know the ideal scenario for people in this country would be for the Premier League to be more like the Championship, with four teams separated by a couple of points and nobody knowing who is going to be promoted or even in the play-offs,â€? said Mourinho. â€œBut, since day one, we have been top. We are boring.â€? They have achieved, lost and regained a hefty lead en route but have suffered only two defeats in 31 league games. Life may have become more of a grind in recent months, with key performers off colour or hampered by niggling injuries, but they have still been relentless. Other sides would have been held by a stubborn Queens Park Rangers team last Sunday but Chelsea pilfered a winner late on with their only shot on target. If only privately, the sight of Cesc FÃ bregas scoring and John Terry leading the post-match celebrations on the pitch at Loftus Road must have knocked the stuffing out of those teams who count themselves as challengers. United are principal among them. Their dismantling of City in the derby confirmed that Louis van Gaal, once Mourinhoâ€™s mentor, is overseeing a team who will be capable of restoring the club to the pinnacle. Go unblemished from now until the end of the season, winning at Stamford Bridge and overcoming Arsenal at Old Trafford on 17 May, and could they still have a chance? â€œItâ€™s still possible,â€? said the Dutchman. â€œItâ€™s not logical but it is possible. Itâ€™s more when and if â€“ and I donâ€™t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. All right, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal, so we can lay pressure on Chelseaâ€™s shoulders. You never know. Youâ€™ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons â€¦â€? He will need his team to buck a trend and click from the outset at the Bridge if the first wound is to be inflicted. Van Gaal conceded his side â€œhavenâ€™t played well for 90 minutesâ€? under his stewardship, citing even the opening 15 minutes against City as slack. They will travel without Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Marcos Rojo, surely weakening their challenge. â€œI disagree because their squad is amazing, in numbers, players, experience, solutions,â€? offered Mourinho. â€œEvery week in my office we put up on the big screen the squad and the options our opponents will have. When I looked this week, for the first time I realised what they have. Itâ€™s amazing.â€? One of their options is Juan Mata, a player sold by Chelsea as part of their new policy of balancing lavish purchases with heftier sales. So does Uefaâ€™s financial fair play now play into Unitedâ€™s hands? â€œYes, itâ€™s easier for them,â€? Mourinho said. â€œIt was easier before at Chelsea. We sold a lot of players, not just Juan, but I think itâ€™s more fun like this. More difficult of course but more fun.â€? Even working within financial constrictions is apparently enjoyable these days. he Portuguese insisted this seasonâ€™s race, for all its lack of variety at the top, had been tougher than ever, with the challenge offered up from teams in mid-table, or even those near the foot, rendering everything a grind. Which makes him all the more baffled, even after six defeats in eight games, by the recent criticism of Cityâ€™s manager, Manuel Pellegrini. â€œWhat Iâ€™m surprised about is that people can bring this team to hell, a side that won two titles in three years, a team who are still champions and won two trophies last season. It looks like they donâ€™t deserve respect, that they are bad players, that the manager is a bad manager, that they are a disaster â€“ but they are the champions. â€œI donâ€™t understand. On the one hand people want competitiveness in this country and you donâ€™t like a team to win two titles in a row or be dominant. You want lots of teams fighting for the title. OK, they wonâ€™t win the Premier League this time but they did last year. Some managers cannot win and â€˜life goes onâ€™ but the guys at Manchester City? It looks like theyâ€™re criminals.â€? While tacit praise for Pellegrini may simply have been an indication Mourinho does not consider City under the Chileanâ€™s stewardship a threat, there was a thinly veiled poke at Wenger in that argument. That suggests the buildup to the trip to Arsenal next weekend could be spikier but, for now, the angst is all elsewhere. Chelsea are 11 points from their first title in five years. Those at their back can only live in hope.

Title:Nottingham Forest 1-3 Watford | Championship match report
Date:2015-04-15
Content:The Watford manager, Slavisa Jokanovic, is trying to keep his calm as the big finish to an enthralling Championship season reaches its peak. Having seen what the rest of the congested top eight did on Tuesday, Watford needed to win by three goals to take themselves into second place, above Norwich, with the smell of automatic promotion in their nostrils. They did not quite make it, although they are level on points, with three games left to play beginning with Birmingham City at Vicarage Road on Saturday. Watford, with only one defeat in their last 11 games, do look equipped to make the Premier League and a prize estimated at Â£100m. â€œIt is a good fight for everyone who is watching and I am keeping calm and trying to enjoy it,â€? Jokanovic said. â€œI am not thinking about second place, the play-offs or what our promotion rivals do. â€œThis was a difficult game for us at Nottingham Forest, the history of the club, this historic stadium, and they pushed us hard. But if we are not motivated now we will never be. My players are motivated and so am I for what is to come.â€? Odion Ighalo, with his 20th goal of the season, and Matthew Connolly set it up for Watford but then it got tricky. Forest were reduced to 10 men when Kelvin Wilson was sent off with 31 minutes to go for kicking out at Ighalo but it did not stop them worrying Watford. Gary Gardner scored with a superb free-kick and Watford had to deal with some pressure when they might have judged the game to have been won. They had to wait until the 87th minute when Karl Darlow beat away AdlÃ¨ne Guediouraâ€™s 30-yard drive and it fell to Almen Abdi to tuck away to secure victory. Forest were on top both before and immediately after Ighaloâ€™s goal but it did not matter, Watford had drawn first blood. Ikechi Anya took a corner that the centre-half Craig Cathcart headed on for Ighalo to head downward and in, from about six yards, at the far post. It was the kind of goal Forest would have been drilled not to concede, something their manager, Dougie Freedman, will work on. He revealed after the game he has signed a new two-year deal. Watford were eight goals short of their club record of 92 in a season going into this game, so Forest could not say they had not been warned. And they tried to do something about it. The Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes had already made a good save with his legs from Chris Burke after two minutes and, after Ighaloâ€™s goal, he made two more from Michail Antonio and Ben Osborn. Tit for tat, shot for shot, it continued as Abdi missed a great chance for a second Watford goal in the 23rd minute when, free through the middle of Forestâ€™s defence, he put his shot wide. Gomes made his fourth outstanding save in the 39th minute from Eric Lichajâ€™s crunching volley but then Forest were picked off again four minutes before half-time. Connolly made the goal and scored it. He got hold of the ball, ran virtually the length of the field and fed Ighalo. Darlow saved at Ighaloâ€™s feet but, when the ball ran free, Connolly was there to tap in for his first goal in two years.
Title:Norwich City 0-1 Middlesbrough | Championship match report
Date:2015-04-17
Content:To the winners â€“ a place on top of the Championship, if only for a few hours. To the defeated â€“ heartache and potentially an end to their hopes of automatic promotion as the play-offs beckon. Such were the high stakes being competed for at Carrow Road when an early own goal from Alex Tettey gave Middlesbrough a crucial win and brought the Premier League closer into focus. However, with Norwich City now two points adrift of Boro and one point behind Bournemouth, which might become four on Saturday, the end-of-season lottery looks to be the likely route for the Norfolk club if they are to recapture their place in the top flight at the first attempt. Middlesbrough had a golden chance late in the game to make their victory more emphatic but even though they could lose the top spot on Saturday, with their promotion rivals Bournemouth and Watford both playing at home, they have put themselves firmly back in contention in what appears now to be a three-horse race for the leading two positions. â€œItâ€™s been an amazing week,â€? said Boroâ€™s manager, Aitor Karanka. â€œTo win three games in six days, especially this one at Norwich when people were expecting us to lose. Iâ€™m very proud of my players. Once again they proved that when they are at their best they can beat anybody.â€? The purpose and quality behind Middlesbroughâ€™s start caught Norwich by surprise and resulted in a stream of corners â€“ any of which could have led to them going in front. There was a sharpness about them that belied their recent poor run on their travels, with defeats at both Bournemouth and Watford preceding this. Jelle Vossen was only just stifled out of it when Tomas Kalas did well to chase down a long pass and send the ball across. The same player then fired the ball narrowly over on the volley after Albert Adomahâ€™s driven centre had been helped on by Patrick Bamford. A delightful reverse pass from Lee Tomlin then sent Bamford striding through. Only SÃ©bastien Bassong with a vital interception prevented Vossen from helping himself to a tap-in. However, the eighth-minute corner offered no respite to Norwich as the ball caught the back of Tetteyâ€™s head and was over the line before Adomah arrived to make sure. â€œThe first 20 minutes cost us the game,â€? lamented the Norwich manager, Alex Neil, who had overseen 14 wins and only two defeats in his first 19 games since succeeding Neil Adams. â€œIt now looks as if we will be involved in the play-offs, so we have to dust ourselves down and go again. Thereâ€™s no point feeling sorry for ourselves.â€? It was a remorseless encounter with both sides giving their all. Norwich managed to put their poor start behind them and dominated possession for the remaining 70 minutes but Boro had a huge prize to defend and they did it superbly. Clear openings were at a premium, although Norwichâ€™s Jonny Howson will be rueing his failure to plant a header on target midway through the first half after Bradley Johnson had nodded the ball across at the back post. With Cameron Jerome well shackled by Daniel Ayala it was the sinuous runs of the sprightly Wes Hoolahan that offered Norwichâ€™s most likely route to an equaliser. Carrow Road howled for a penalty when he went tumbling over in the area just before the interval but the referee Robert Madleyâ€™s only response was to show him the yellow card for diving. The temperature increased as Neil sent on both Lewis Grabban and Gary Hooper to augment Jerome but still the visitors held firm, with Ben Gibson throwing himself in the way of a Russell Martin piledriver in the dying moments. Norwich had several penalty appeals waved away. It all became pretty desperate but the course of the game remained unchanged. Seldom can victory and defeat have potentially meant so much for the two teams involved.

For the fourth consecutive match, they didnâ€™t play particularly well but did enough to grind out the result - it may not be particularly pretty, but they wonâ€™t care. A moment of class from Oscar and Eden Hazard was enough to win them all three points. They need six more to win the league and have six matches in which to get them. Itâ€™s all over and their players know it. Theyâ€™re celebrating as if theyâ€™ve won the league already. This was a big win for them and they handled Manchester United admirably.

He lays it off to Rooney, who plays it wide to Di Maria. Probe. Probe. Probe. Probe. Nothing. Barring a moment or two of genius, you get the impression that Chelsea will comfortably defend against this all night if they have to. Thibaut Courtois hasnâ€™t had to make a save that I can remember in this second half. He wasnâ€™t kept too busy in the first 45 minutes either. 7.07pm BST 79 min: Manchester United substitution: Tyler Blackett on for Luke Shaw, who has played very well but is still recovering from hamstring issues. 7.06pm BST 77 min: From the left flank, Shaw plays the ball into Di Maria whoâ€™d made a run into the left side of the Chelsea penalty area. He proceeds to run down a blind alley, where he is mugged by Nemanja Matic, among others.

Smalling launches the ball forward, straight into the arms of Thibaut Courtois. 6.33pm BST Chelsea v Man Utd - second half is under way Chelsea do the honours, with no changes on either side. They lead 1-0 and are 45 minutes away from being just two wins from the title. 6.31pm BST Half-time housekeeping ... David De Gea almost certainly handled the ball outside his penalty area in the first half, but the linesman was unsighted John Terry almost certainly fouled Radamel Falcao when winning possession in the build-up to Chelseaâ€™s goal, but no free-kick was awarded. Oscarâ€™s backheel to Hazard in the build-up to the Chelsea goal was a thing of great beauty. 6.19pm BST Half-time: Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United Without playing particularly well, Chelsea adjourn to the dressing room behind on possession stats, but leading with the only stat that matters. Their players will be delighted, Manchester Unitedâ€™s seething but confident of turning things around in the second half. Eden Hazard has given the hosts the lead with the kind of finish weâ€™ve come to expect him to score in his sleep. Updated at 7.27pm BST 6.17pm BST 45 min: Manchester United win a corner, their first on the right, I think. Juan Mata floats the ball into the area, where Courtois grabs it under little or no pressure. 6.15pm BST 42 min: Itâ€™s getting tasty between John Terry and Radamel Falcao. Showing the kind of macho spirit that was conspicuously absent in the build-up to the goal, Falcao shoves the Chelsea at a throw-in, knocking him to the ground. Seconds later, Terry returns the favour with interest, clattering into the Colombianâ€™s back to win a high ball. Falcao complains to the referee, who tells him to get on with the game. Updated at 6.15pm BST 6.12pm BST 40 min: That was a splendid goal by Chelsea, which originated when Radamel Falcao meekly allowed himself to be dispossessed by John Terry. He gave the ball to Fabregas, who played it forward to Oscar, whereupon the Brazilian played the ball through the inside-left to Hazard with a wonderful backheel.

Eden Hazard slots a diagonal shot through David De Geaâ€™s legs and into the back of the net after being played in behind the United defence to latch on to a beautifully weighted pass from Oscar. Eden Hazard celebrates scoring the opener from a Hazard pass. Photograph: Nigel French/PA Updated at 6.25pm BST 6.08pm BST 36 min: With Chelsea on a counter-attack, David De Gea charges towards the edge of his penalty area to intercept a long ball from Fabregas to Hazard. He handles the ball outside his area, but no free-kick for Chelsea is forthcoming. 6.07pm BST 35 min: Manchester United win a free-kick about 40 metres from the Chelsea goal. Ashley Young attempts to send the ball into the mixer, but fails to clear the first man. [Minute-by-minute reporter throws his hands in the air in frustration]. 6.05pm BST 33 min: With his back to goal on the edge of the Chelsea penalty area, Ashley Young expertly kills a pass sent whizzing his way from midfield and plays it wide to Luke shaw on the touchline. The cross comes in and Chelsea clear. 6.03pm BST 31 min: Ander Herrera gets fouled by Didier Drogba just outside his own penalty area and goes down screaming in agony. Incredibly, heâ€™s perfectly fit to continue 30 seconds or so later, after the pair exchange a hadshake and Mike Dean gives the Ivorian a ticking-off. Didier Drogba vies for the ball with Manchester Unitedâ€™s Ander Herrera. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP Updated at 6.10pm BST 6.01pm BST 29 min: Chelsea win a free-kick about 35 metres from the United goal, a little left of centre. Falcao it was, with the foul on Hazard. Drogba steps up and shoots ... straight into the defensive wall. It seems nobody here can strike a dead ball with anything resembling expertise today. 5.59pm BST 25 min: Chelseaâ€™s back four are sitting back like a team of non-league minnows attempting to protect a 1-0 lead against a Premier League side in the dying seconds of an FA Cup match. Theyâ€™re giving Manchester United acres of space to run at them, but United are failing to string anything in the way of decent passing moves or crosses together. Updated at 5.59pm BST 5.56pm BST 24 min: United win another corner, which goes the way of all their previous corners: Mata tries to find Fellaini but doesnâ€™t, then Chelsea clear. Referee Mike Dean had spotted an infringement anyway and blows for a Chelsea free-kick. Itâ€™s not like heâ€™s an inconspicuous target ... Updated at 5.57pm BST 5.55pm BST 23 min: Deep in United territory on the inside left, Hazard plays the ball back to Cesc Fabregas on the edge of the penalty area. He plays a return pass by way of a beutifully weighted through ball, but Hazardâ€™s first touch lets him down. Turns out he was offside anyway. 5.53pm BST 21 min: Fellaini squares the ball a few yards into Rooney from the left touchline and the Manchester United captain sends a cross-field pass towards Ander Herrera. Thereâ€™s too much welly on it, but he gets a thumbs-up from the intended recipient anyway. 5.51pm BST 20 min: On Sky Sports, co-commentator Gary Neville says that Chelseaâ€™s shape is â€œall wrongâ€?. Oscar is â€œtoo narrowâ€?, apparently, while Fabregas has moved out to the right and Hazard is now playing just behind Drogba. Their midfield is being completely over-run, where Matic and Zouma are struggling to get on the ball. 5.49pm BST 17 min: Corner for Manchester United, which Mata takes again. Once again, he fails to pick out Fellaini and Eden Hazard clears for the home side. 5.48pm BST 16 min: With Rooney and Herrera exchanging passes in the centre of midfield, Fellaini takes up possession on the left touchline. The ball doesnâ€™t come his way and Chelsea end up winning a free-kick just outside their own penalty area. 5.46pm BST 15 min: United continue to dominate possession, but arenâ€™t creating much in the way of chances. A few shots from long distance have been the sum total of their efforts so far. None of them have been on target. Jose Mourinho dosnâ€™t look too happy as United dominate possession. Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Reuters Updated at 6.06pm BST 5.45pm BST 13 min: That was pretty impressive from Paddy McNair, who picked up the ball on halfway and beat three or four players before having his pop from outside the area. It wasnâ€™t too wide of its intended target. 5.44pm BST 12 min: A speculative Paddy McNair shot from about 25 metres earns Manchester United a corner after taking a slight deflection off John Terry. Eden Hazard sends the ball towards Fellainiâ€™s head, but Chelsea clear. 5.42pm BST 11 min: Ander Herrera tries his luck from a long way out after Shaw and Young had combined down the left. He drags a feeble shot wide, when perhaps he should have picked out Juan Mata, whoâ€™d made a nice run. 5.41pm BST 8 min: Holding Young off the ball down by the corner flag and repeatedly calling for a goal-kick, Ivanovic is frustrated that he doesnâ€™t get one, because the whole of the ball hasnâ€™t crossed the line. Showing no little agility, he turns and hoofs it upfield in one fluid(ish) movement. 5.39pm BST 7 min: Chelsea advance, with Eden Hazard on the ball on the inside left flank. Hazard picks out a Cesc Fabregas into the Manchester United penalty area, but from a tight angle, heâ€™s unable to get the ball across the box. De Gea sticks out a foot to block his attempted cross. Ander Herrera slides to try and block a shot from Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas. Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Updated at 6.03pm BST 5.37pm BST 5 min: Youâ€™d have put the farm on Rooney scoring from that chance. He was unmarked in acres of space when he picked up Shawâ€™s fine pass and had plenty of time to pick his spot. 5.36pm BST 3 min: Luke Shaw gallops down the touchline on the overlap, picks up a pass from Ashley Young and leaves Branislav Ivanovic in his dust. Cutting in along the byline, he pulls the ball back to Wayne Rooney on the edge of the penalty area. He shoots and hits one of the poles holding up the back of the net. I thought heâ€™d scored and so did David de Gea and the supporters behind his goal, who were all celebrating wildly. Wide, but not by much. 5.33pm BST 2 min: Kurt Zouma robs Marouane Fellaine of the ball wide on the right halfway inside the Chelsea half and passes the ball back to his goalkeeper. Fellaini claims he was fouled, but no free-kick is forthcoming. 5.32pm BST Chelsea v Manchester United is under way 1 min: Weâ€™re off. Manchester United get the ball rolling. Rooney and Herrera are playing alongside each other deep in Unitedâ€™s midfield. Chris Smalling is playing as their right centre-back, while McNair is on the left. 5.30pm BST Prediction time: For all the talk of potential bus-parking on Chelseaâ€™s part, I foresee goals in this one. Manchester Unitedâ€™s defence looks porous on paper at least, while their attack has been banging in them lately: Chelsea 3-2 Manchester United - Iâ€™m predicting a humdinger. Iâ€™ll look forward to being scoffed at afterwards by all those people who wait until the game is over before revealing what they thought the score will be. 5.28pm BST Not long now: The teams are lined up in the tunnel, where John Terry and Wayne Rooney enjoy a manly handshake. Having had the studs/blades on their garish boots inspected by the match officials, they march out on to the Stamford Bridge pitch and line up for the pre-match niceties. Eden Hazard is holding hands with a mascot that is not much shorter than him. Kick-off is in three minutes. 5.18pm BST Â£82, eh? Â£82. Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Action Images 5.16pm BST On Sky Sports: Theyâ€™re analysing the pattern of play in Manchester Unitedâ€™s warm-up and surmising that it suggests Ander Herrera will start at the base of midfield, with Wayne Rooney on the right. Time will tell, I suppose. 5.11pm BST On Sky Sports: Graeme Souness says that Chelsea are set up in a â€œfairly negativeâ€? way, adding that theyâ€™re missing a mobile striker, which will limit what they can do. He also says that when Louis van Gaal sees Kurt Zouma in the Chelsea line-up, heâ€™ll know that Chjelsea are just going to be content for him to â€œsit in thereâ€? and try to nick the game on the break.

Chelsea striker Diego Costa remains sidelined with his twanged hamstring, but Loic Remy could make a comeback from the calf injury that forced him to sit out his teamâ€™s slightly fortuitous win against QPR last weekend. Otherwise, Chelsea are largely injury free. Manchester United have a comparatively lengthy list of the lame and halt, particularly in their defensive ranks. With Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones, Daley Blind and Michael Carrick forming an orderly queue outside the treatment room, while Jonny Evans continues his occupation of the naughty step, Louis van Gaal will have to choose two from Chris Smalling, Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair to form a centre-back partnership that could prompt much drooling around the chops of various Chelsea players. Chris Smalling is likely to be the senior player in the heart of Manchester Unitedâ€™s defence. Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images 3.45pm BST Barry will be here shortly.
Title:Reading v Arsenal: FA Cup semi-final â€“ as it happened | Scott Murray
Date:2015-04-18
Content:7.52pm BST FULL TIME: Reading 1-2 Arsenal Sanchez hits a lame free kick, but no matter! The whistle goes for full time, and heâ€™s the two-goal hero! Arsenal, the FA Cup holders, have reached the 2015 final! And theyâ€™ve done it at the expense of brave Reading, and poor old Adam Federici. The Reading keeper has one of those thousand-yard stares going on, and he departs the scene in tears, the poor fellow. But while, yes, his error ultimately cost Reading, he was one of 14 heroes in blue and white tonight. Arsenal were below par, Reading were well above theirs, but it wasnâ€™t quite enough for the Championship side. A brilliant game of football, though, which deserves to be remembered for more than one goalkeeping mishap. Letâ€™s hope Reading donâ€™t have to wait another 88 years for their next shot at the final. Updated at 7.55pm BST 7.51pm BST ET 30 min: Walcott zips down the inside-right channel. Heâ€™s upended by Williams, inches before he enters the box. That could have been a penalty, you know. But it probably wonâ€™t matter. A free kick on the edge of the area, and the clockâ€™s nearly run out. 7.50pm BST ET 29 min: Arsenal are sitting back, opting to keep hold of what they have. McCleary tries to break down the right, but Ozil mops up marvellously. Arsenal havenâ€™t been at their best, not by a long chalk, but theyâ€™ve put in a shift all right this evening. 7.49pm BST ET 27 min: Karacan sets Mackie clear down the inside-right channel, but the strikerâ€™s a yard offside. Reading have their foot to the floor, but theyâ€™re dangerously low on gas. 7.48pm BST ET 26 min: Sanchez goes on a baroque dribble down the left and into the Reading box. He very nearly breaks through, but some pinball nonsense goes Readingâ€™s way, the ball breaking into Federiciâ€™s hands down by the near post. How the keeper will wish heâ€™d gathered Sanchezâ€™s shot like that. The poor lad. 7.45pm BST ET 25 min: Reading are pinning Arsenal back. Obita makes space down the left and lifts a ball into the middle, which Arsenal clear, but only after a mild struggle. Goodness me, but theyâ€™ve been made to work for this. 7.44pm BST ET 24 min: Throw for Reading, deep in Arsenal territory down the left. The ball ends up at Williamsâ€™ feet, on the left-hand corner of the Arsenal box. Heâ€™s got options inside, but a large headline floats across his line of vision, and he looks to whistle a spectacular shot into the top right. Nope! 7.43pm BST ET 22 min: Ramsey and Ozil exchange passes down the inside-left channel. Ozil, free in the area, should shoot, but slides the ball to Giroud on his left. Giroud beats Federici, but the ball bounces off the base of the left-hand post and out! That would have put an end to it, but Reading still have hope! 7.42pm BST ET 21 min: Arsenal enjoy a period of possession in the middle of the park. Tick tock, tick tock. And the last roll of Readingâ€™s dice: Pogrebnyak, who has had his chances, makes way for Yakubu. 7.40pm BST ET 19 min: Obita chips the free kick into the mixer. Pogrebnyak challenges Szczesny under the high ball. The keeper wins. 7.39pm BST ET 18 min: Williams scampers down the inside-left channel. Itâ€™s a really determined run, and one which forces Gabriel to step across the Reading midfielder, performing an agricultural bodycheck. A yellow card for the defender, and a free kick 30 yards from goal. 7.37pm BST ET 17 min: Ozil jigs around down the inside-left channel and, on the edge of the box, drags a lame effort across the front of goal and out on the right. 7.37pm BST ET 16 min: Cox comes on for Chalobah. Sanchez sees an effort blocked on the edge of the Reading box. Mackie goes up the other end, cutting in from the left and looking to power a curler into the top right. Nope! Thatâ€™s three rugby points. But this period of extra time promises to be quite an event, for itâ€™s now or never for Reading. 7.35pm BST EXTRA TIME, HALF TIME: Reading 1-2 Arsenal What a shocker for poor Federici. 7.34pm BST GOAL! Reading 1-2 Arsenal (Sanchez 15+1 ET) Sanchez cuts inside from the left, enters the area, and lashes a low shot towards the bottom-left corner. It should be easily claimed by Federici, but disaster for the keeper, who lets the ball squirt through his hands and between his legs. And into the net, at excruciating, tortoise speed. Oh my. What a shame for the keeper, and for Reading. But Arsenal are 15 minutes from the final! Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici scrambles for the ball after letting the shot from Arsenalâ€™s Alexis Sanchez through his legs for their second goal. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA Updated at 7.47pm BST 7.33pm BST ET 15 min: Ozil stumbles over the ball in the centre circle. Suddenly Pogrebnyak is romping down the inside-left channel, acres of space in front of him. But his shot, when he enters the area, is blocked. Arsenal go up the other end, and ... 7.31pm BST ET 13 min: Ramsey, 30 yards from goal, sends a powerful daisycutter straight at goal. Federici is down to parry, and is very lucky to see the ball squirt behind him and balloon over the crossbar, the goal gaping. The cornerâ€™s cleared. Ramsey, not for the first time, was very close to reclaiming the lead for Arsenal there. 7.29pm BST ET 11 min: Walcott comes on for Coquelin, Arsene Wenger deciding that a defensive midfielder is a pointless luxury with Reading sitting deep, seemingly already playing for penalty kicks. 7.28pm BST ET 10 min: Cazorla lifts a ball straight down the middle, springing Giroud clear! The striker canâ€™t latch onto the pass, and Federici, on the edge of his box, claims. The flag goes up for offside, but that was generous to Reading, the striker a yard on. Probably just as well Giroud didnâ€™t slot that away, under those circumstances. 7.27pm BST ET 8 min: But Arsenal are enjoying the lionâ€™s share of possession, and therefore look the most likely to carve out a chance. Some space down the left for Sanchez, who reaches the byline and chips into the centre, but thereâ€™s nobody there in a red shirt, and Federici plucks the ball from the sky with ease. 7.25pm BST ET 7 min: Arsenal pass it around a lot, but achieve absolutely nothing. Itâ€™s a patient display right now, if nothing else. 7.23pm BST ET 6 min: A little space for Gibbs down the left. He makes his way into the area and threads a cross into the middle while falling backwards. Federici claims with ease. Arsenal look very pedestrian right now. 7.22pm BST ET 5 min: Corner to Reading, earned off a couple of throws down the right flank. A dreadful corner is whacked clear by Cazorla. 7.21pm BST ET 3 min: Space for Cazorla, 25 yards out, in the middle of the park. Three rugby points. A dismal effort from a brilliant footballer, a good chance spurned. Arsenalâ€™s day in a nutshell. Arsenalâ€™s day so far, that is. 7.19pm BST ET 1 min: Mackie powers his way down the left, cuts inside, then slips a ball back out to the wing for Pogrebnyak. His pass is behind his team-mate, and thatâ€™s a throw. But thereâ€™s a sign of renewed - or is it continued? - purpose from Reading. 7.17pm BST For the second time in 12 months, Arsenal are taken to extra time by a Championship side in the FA Cup semis. And weâ€™re off again, for the first period of extra time! Arsenal are, once again, ready first. Much good it did them in that second half. Reading faff around in their huddle, but eventually come out to play. They kick off. 7.12pm BST FULL TIME: Reading 1-1 Arsenal Karacan bundles Sanchez over, just in front of the centre circle. Cazorla lofts the set piece into the box. Giroud meets it, and looks to plant a header into the top right, but a weak effort goes straight to Federici. And thatâ€™s that! Weâ€™ll have 30 minutes of extra time, and itâ€™s no more than heroic Reading deserve! 7.10pm BST 90 min +1: Gibbs probes down the left wing and wins a corner off Gunter. Ozil takes. Pearce welts clear. 7.09pm BST 90 min: Karacan comes on for Robson-Kanu. There will be two added minutes. 7.09pm BST 89 min: Mackie goes on a romp down the right, and curls a low ball into the centre, but with Pogrebnyak heading into the area, Szczesny comes out to claim well. Arsenal go up the other end, Gibbs making good down the left and finding Ramsey on the edge of the six-yard box! A first-time swing of the boot, and the ballâ€™s flying over the bar! 7.07pm BST 87 min: And now itâ€™s Readingâ€™s turn to wonder what if? Pogrebnyak is racing towards the Arsenal box, with only Koscielny ahead of him, and Mackie to his left! Itâ€™s two on one, but the big striker elects to go on his own, and loses control as he reaches the edge of the box! What a chance spurned! Mackie has every right to be livid there. A first-ever place in an FA Cup final was within reach for Reading! 7.05pm BST 84 min: Arsenal hit the post! Eh? How? Ramsey, last yearâ€™s FA Cup final hero against Hull, breaks into the Reading box, after a Giroud pass down the left channel. He slams the ball into Federici, then rounds him on the left, and has an open goal ahead of him! Well, sort of: heâ€™s faced with a tight-ish angle, and with Gunter on the line. He should still score, though. And Ramsey batters his shot against the left-hand post, from the left-hand corner of the six-yard box! Wow. A place in the final was there for the taking there. Aaron Ramsey hits the post from close range. Photograph: Christopher Lee/The FA/Getty Updated at 7.18pm BST 7.03pm BST 83 min: Chalobah takes a stride down the inside-left channel, cuts inside a bit, and launches a dipper towards the bottom left. Szczesny makes a meal of the save, punching it round the post for a corner, which is easily cleared. 7.01pm BST 82 min: Ramsey attempts to sashay his way into space, running at pace past a couple of half-challenges down the inside-right channel. Heâ€™s crowded off the ball just before he breaks into the area. That was a run loaded with danger, though. So close to carving out a shooting chance for himself. 7.00pm BST 81 min: The crowd at Wembley hasnâ€™t let up for a single minute. Bedlam. And no wonder: this has been superlative entertainment. 6.59pm BST 79 min: Reading might have preferred the free kick back there. Theyâ€™d have been doubly annoyed had Ozil scored here, which he nearly did, latching onto a Sanchez pullback down the inside-left channel before lashing an effort towards the top-left corner a shade wide and high. 6.58pm BST 78 min: Mackie is bundled over by Coquelin, 30 yards out down the inside-left channel. Pogrebnyak bursts away with the loose ball, enters the area, and drags a shot across the face of goal and out of play. 6.56pm BST 76 min: Sanchez slips a ball down the inside-right channel for Giroud, but overhits it. Federici claims. Arsenal were dreadful for a period after the Reading goal, but theyâ€™re beginning to impose themselves again, albeit not totally. Updated at 6.56pm BST 6.54pm BST 74 min: McCleary robs the ball off Ozil in the centre circle, but only after standing on his ankle. No foul, never mind a booking. Mackie bombs down the right and wins a corner. Arsenal clear it, but only after a quick game of pinball in their area. Good luck in guessing which way this is going to go. 6.52pm BST 73 min: Ramsey is dragged back by Robson-Kanu down the Arsenal right. Free kick. Ozil takes. The ballâ€™s curled onto the head of Gabriel, eight yards out. Heâ€™s got to score, but squirts an awful header miles to the right and a good deal over the bar too. What a miss! On another day, heâ€™d be celebrating his second goal in four minutes! Gabriel Paulista heads at goal under pressure from Nathaniel Chalobah. Photograph: Steve Bardens/The FA/Getty Updated at 7.07pm BST 6.51pm BST 72 min: Welbeck is replaced by Giroud. 6.50pm BST 71 min: A free kick for Reading down the right wing. Obita will take, his team-mates populating the Arsenal box in number. And itâ€™s an appalling delivery, curled out of play on the left, over everyoneâ€™s head. 6.49pm BST 69 min: Or has it?!! But Arsenal win a corner, Ozil threading a pass down the left channel to earn a deflected corner. The set piece is whipped to the near post, where Gabriel meets it on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. He belts a header towards the top left, and it would be in were it not for Federici arcing his back and sticking out a strong hand. Reading clear the loose ball. So unfortunate! 6.47pm BST 67 min: Mackie embarks on a rococo run down the left. He chases Gabriel to the byline, then cuts back and chips the ball to Williams, free on the edge of the area! If Williams blams that with any purpose, Arsenal are in trouble. But he screws a dreadful volley well wide right of the goal. Arsenal breathe again. Reading are full of confidence here. Arsenalâ€™s has evaporated. 6.45pm BST 66 min: Reading claim a penalty after a cross is hammered at Debuchyâ€™s arm from about two yards away. Needless to say, it isnâ€™t given. 6.42pm BST 64 min: Gabriel comes on for a slightly limping Mertesacker. 6.42pm BST 62 min: The excellent McCleary lifts a pass down the right. Koscielny miscontrols, and nearly lets Mackie scoot away down the wing. He gets a lucky bounce, and the danger is averted as he wins a throw. 6.40pm BST 60 min: Robson-Kanu romps down the middle and flicks a little pass right for Pogrebnyak, who very nearly bursts through the middle and towards the area. But he miscontrols. Arsenal were lucky to get away with that, with their defence backtracking in a very uncertain fashion. 6.38pm BST 58 min: Arsenal are all over the shop at the moment. Not many passes finding feet right now. That goal really has shaken everyone in Wembley, one way or another. 6.36pm BST 57 min: Arsenal, collectively, looked stunned. Robson-Kanu makes off down the left and whips a ball into the middle. Pogrebnyak shapes to Zidane a volley home, 2002 Champions League final style, from the penalty spot. But Mertesacker eyebrows the ball away before it reaches the striker. Jamie Mackie celebrates Garath McClearyâ€™s goal which clearly crossed the line past Wojciech Szczesny. Photograph: Steve Bardens/The FA/Getty Updated at 6.52pm BST 6.35pm BST GOAL! Reading 1-1 Arsenal (McCleary 54) Well this all happened in slow motion! Pogrebnyak made it to the byline, to the left of goal. He chips it to the far post, where McCleary - Readingâ€™s best player today - slaps a first-time effort goalwards from a tight angle. Thereâ€™s a small deflection off Gibbs, and the ball squirts past Szczesny and into the bottom-right corner. The keeper clutches the ball in mid-air and kids on it didnâ€™t cross the line, but thatâ€™s a goal. And the underdogs are right back in this! Readingâ€™s Garath McCleary celebrates the equaliser. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA Updated at 6.44pm BST 6.32pm BST 53 min: Williams slips the ball down the left to release Robson-Kanu into space. Pogrebnyak is the only man in the middle, and the cross is launched high over the crossbar. Thatâ€™s awful at any level. 6.31pm BST 51 min: Chalobah, in Ozil Country, tries a similar pass to the one that led to the goal. Itâ€™s a decent sliderule effort down the inside-right channel, finding Pogrebnyak on the edge of the area, but the big Russian is no Sanchez and canâ€™t turn quickly enough. Arsenal close up all the gaps. But a decent move nonetheless. Reading should take succour from it. Theyâ€™ll have to. 6.29pm BST 49 min: Free kick for Arsenal, 40 yards from goal, to the left of centre. Cazorla hoicks the ball into the box, and Mertesacker gets ahead of the Reading back line. He meets the ball at the penalty spot, but only with his back turned. It rolls down the number 4 on his shirt and harmlessly out to the left of goal, Federici shepherding it out. That was a real chance. Goodness knows why he met the ball mid-spin. 6.27pm BST 48 min: Cazorla has time and space down the left, and Sanchez ahead of him in the box. His scoop forward is obvious and cut out by Hector. 6.26pm BST 47 min: No top-flight side in the Premier League era has lost to a team from a lower division in an FA Cup semi. The last team from the lower reaches to beat a first-division side at this stage? Sunderland, in 1992, who did for Norwich City before losing to Liverpool in the final. A free kick for Reading in the middle of the Arsenal half. Reading load the box but Williamsâ€™ delivery is appalling. 6.24pm BST And weâ€™re off again! No changes. Arsenal are first out onto the pitch, and theyâ€™re left waiting a wee while by Reading, who eventually emerge a minute or so later. Arsenal get the ball rolling for the second period. 6.11pm BST Half-time entertainment: Readingâ€™s greatest day at Wembley, the 1988 Simod Cup final, a 4-1 victory over the much-fancied Luton Town. This footage is clearly culled from one of those early club-specific VHS productions, a singular voiceover, garish on-screen captioning, a gratuitously intrusive soundtrack of ostentatious Yamaha DX7 noodling, all that. Magnificent. The imperial phase of official club merchandise, in my book. 6.10pm BST HALF TIME: Reading 0-1 Arsenal McCleary breaks down the right and nearly fashions a chance in the centre for Williams. But no. Chalobah is booked for a ludicrously late slide on Gibbs down the right. And thatâ€™s that for the first half. Reading will be glad to hear the whistle. They need to regroup after the blow of the goal. But theyâ€™ve been impressive on the whole. Arsenal, too long in the tooth to make any brazen assumptions, wonâ€™t be making plans for the final yet. The second half should be fascinating. No flipping! 6.06pm BST 44 min: Arsenal are pinging it around with added confidence now. A few triangles, and suddenly Welbeck is bursting into the box down the inside-right channel. Heâ€™s held up, just, but Debuchy is soon backing him up, and wins a corner down the right. Ozilâ€™s set piece slaps Pearce flush in the mush, and the ball squirts off to the right of goal, not far from the target. The second corner is cleared by Pogrebnyak. 6.03pm BST 42 min: Reading had been doing so well, too, but thereâ€™s the difference between an in-form Premier League side and one struggling towards the foot of the Championship. A little frustration, as Williams clips Sanchez on the ankles, deliberate rather than simply late. Heâ€™s very fortunate to escape a booking. 6.02pm BST GOAL! Reading 0-1 Arsenal (Sanchez 39) But quality is always going to tell! Ozil makes a little space for himself in the middle of the Reading half. A gentle lift down the middle, and he finds Sanchez clear, in space, just inside the Reading box! Sanchez takes a touch, then another to send Hector sliding off the wrong way, and finally pokes the ball into the bottom left, calm as you like. What a gorgeous pass, and crisp finish. Alexis Sanchez scores the opening goal for Arsenal. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters Kieran Gibbs and Sanchez celebrates the opener. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images/Reuters Updated at 6.14pm BST 5.59pm BST 37 min: Arsenal are looking a little frustrated right now. Theyâ€™re passing it around crisply in the middle, but running out of ideas on how to move things forward, too. Mackie and Pogrebnyak are snapping at their collective heel, forcing the odd loose pass. Itâ€™s been a very impressive showing by the unfancied Championship side so far. 5.56pm BST 34 min: Space for Obita down the left, not for the first time in this game. Heâ€™s got four team-mates in the box, Reading having broken forward at pace, but the cross is poor and cut out by Debuchy. Reading havenâ€™t given Szczesny that much to do, and yet they have looked far from impotent in attack. 5.55pm BST 33 min: Cazorla pitching-wedges a pass from deep on the right into the centre, for Welbeck to chase. The striker nearly gets to the pass, bombing down the inside-right channel, but Federici is out quickly to the edge of his area to pluck the ball from the sky. 5.53pm BST 31 min: Ramsey nearly opens Reading up down the left with a lovely turn and shimmy, but the Championship side close all the gaps quickly. The ballâ€™s laid off to Sanchez, who drops a shoulder in the hope of getting a shot away on the edge of the D, but again the blue-and-white wall has no gaps. This is a resolute display by Steve Clarkeâ€™s side. 5.51pm BST 28 min: Chalobah slides a gorgeous pass down the inside-right channel to release Mackie in the box! Mackieâ€™s shot is parried by Szczesny, and heâ€™s offside anyway. And then he puts the rebound wide right. No goals yet, but this is a highly entertaining encounter, with Reading standing toe to toe with their Premier League opponents. Alexis Sanchez shoots at Adam Federici, but it remains goalless at Wembley. Photograph: Matthew Lewis/Getty Updated at 5.59pm BST 5.50pm BST 27 min: Cazorla plays a ball down the middle to release Sanchez on goal! Federici races out of his area and slides in. Sanchez pokes the ball to the keeperâ€™s right, then stumbles over as the ball flies off, wide right of goal, safe from Readingâ€™s perspective. Arsenalâ€™s fans claim a free kick, but Sanchez, to his credit, doesnâ€™t claim a thing. The keeper might have brushed his right toe, too, but thatâ€™s top-drawer sportsmanship from Sanchez, who could easily have gone down in an attempt to get the keeper in a lot of trouble. Nathaniel Chalobah challenges Francis Coquelin. Photograph: Steve Bardens/The FA/Getty Updated at 5.55pm BST 5.47pm BST 26 min: Debuchy scampers after a ball down the right flank. He reaches it before it goes out for a goal kick, and whips a stunning up-and-down cross towards Sanchez at the far post. Sanchez rises over Gunter and sends a header towards the top left, but thereâ€™s no pace in it, and Federici gathers. 5.46pm BST 24 min: Gunter helps a ball down the right wing, where McCleary has the spring on Gibbs. He suffers a rush of blood to the noggin upon reaching the ball, though, and hoicks it straight into the crowd behind the goal instead of crossing. It probably made little difference, as he had no team-mates in the Arsenal area. But thereâ€™s a little promise down this flank for Reading. 5.43pm BST 22 min: Gibbs, Welback and Ozil ping pretty triangles down the inside-left channel. The ballâ€™s eventually shuttled right for Cazorla, who attempts to curl one into the top left from 25 yards. Itâ€™s way off target. Reading will be happy to restrict Arsenal to long-distance punts. 5.41pm BST 20 min: Arsenal are beginning to impose themselves now, in terms of possession at least. Much as expected. Theyâ€™ve still only forced Federici into meaningful action once, though. 5.40pm BST 18 min: Ozil whips the ball up over the Reading wall and back down, looking for the top-right corner. Heâ€™s got the beating of Federici, the keeper never getting there, but the ballâ€™s just wide right of the post, and maybe a little high too. That wasnâ€™t far away, though, a lovely effort. 5.39pm BST 17 min: Ozil turns neatly down the inside-right channel and slips the ball forward for Welbeck, who buys a cheap free kick by running into Chalobah. Free kick, 30 yards from goal, level with the right-hand post. This is a very dangerous position. 5.37pm BST 16 min: Ozil slips a clever ball down the left wing for Sanchez, who dances up and down the side of the Reading box. He lifts a ball to the far post, in the hope of finding the marauding Debuchy, but the cross is way too deep. Goal kick. Alexis Sanchez tries to go past Michael Hector. Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters Updated at 5.51pm BST 5.36pm BST 14 min: McCleary is upended down the right, five yards outside the Arsenal box. Free kick. Reading load the box. McCleary opts to take it himself. Welbeck heads clear with not much conviction. Chalobah meets the dropping ball, standing to the left of the D. His shot, a looper aimed for the top-right corner, is deflected out for a corner, which is wasted. But this is a very impressive start to the match by Reading, who look positive, confident and calm. Danny Welbeck pace is causing Reading a few problems, here he evades Chris Gunter. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Updated at 5.43pm BST 5.34pm BST 12 min: After that hectic end-to-end start, a welcome lull. And then Obita hoicks a long ball down the inside-left channel. Mackieâ€™s free on goal! And he looks miles offside, so the flag goes up. Thing is, Mackie had actually bent his run to perfection, and Koscielny was playing him onside. Reading so unlucky, for that was a poor decision. 5.31pm BST 9 min: Reading so nearly conceded there, but theyâ€™re not sulking about it. McCleary makes good down the right and whips a cross into the Arsenal box. Itâ€™s not cleared, and Obita, bombing in from the other flank, meets the ball with a meaty hoof from just outside the area. Itâ€™s straight down Szczesnyâ€™s throat. A lively response indeed. 5.30pm BST 8 min: ... Arsenal nearly score, Mertesacker meeting Ozilâ€™s delivery with a header, six yards out. He heads down towards the bottom right, where Federici scrambles a save. The ballâ€™s blootered out for another corner, from which Mertesacker attempts an elaborate backheel. Nope! So close to the opening goal, though. 5.29pm BST 7 min: Arsenal knock the ball around, hither and yon, in front of the Reading box. The ballâ€™s prodded down the middle towards Ozil, who canâ€™t control properly. The ball breaks to Sanchez, whose shot from the edge of the area is deflected out for a corner on the right. From which ... 5.27pm BST 5 min: Gibbs, in a deep position down the left, sprays a ball along the flank to spring Welbeck clear! If the striker controls, heâ€™s one on one with Federici, entering the area down the left. But thereâ€™s too much pace on the ball. He gets a little contact on it, but only succeeds in poking it past the advancing keeper and out of play, well to the left of the goal. But Reading hearts were in mouths there for a nanosecond or two. Danny Welbeck takes the ball past Adam Federici. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters Updated at 6.18pm BST 5.25pm BST 4 min: Ramsey is down on the halfway line, Obita having accidentally prodded him in the eye. Nothing malicious in it, though that doesnâ€™t stop the Arsenal player wearing an aggrieved look on his coupon. After a brief pad with the magic sponge, heâ€™s OK. 5.24pm BST 3 min: Arsenal show in the Reading half for the first time. Sanchez finds a little space down the left wing, and sprays a diagonal ball towards Ramsey, in an attempt to send his team-mate scampering into the box. Thereâ€™s too much juice on the pass, and thatâ€™s a goal kick. 5.23pm BST 2 min: This is a lovely, positive start from Reading, who win a couple of throws down the right, and keep Arsenal pressed back. Mackie looks to break into space down the right flank, but Sanchez nips in ahead, puts the break on, and earns a free kick, Mackie shoving him in the back. 5.22pm BST Reading organise themselves in a pre-match huddle, then get into their starting positions, and weâ€™re off! The underdogs get the ball rolling, McCleary with the first touch. Obita finds a bit of space down the left. He hooks a cross into the area, but Arsenal clear. Reading on the front foot early doors! 5.18pm BST The teams are out! Reading are playing in their blue-and-white hoops ... Reading jerseys in the dressing room. Other supermarkets are available. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA ... while Arsenal sport their famous red shirts with white sleeves. Itâ€™ll be an aesthetic pleasure, this match. And itâ€™s a blistering atmosphere on a sunny day at Wembley Stadium. Once a few photos are taken, coins tossed and hands shaken, the first of the 2015 FA Cup semi finals will be underway! 4.38pm BST The team news. Pavel Pogrebnyak has been feeling his calf, but itâ€™s not been enough to stop him playing in Readingâ€™s biggest game for 88 years. Meanwhile a couple of big names return for Arsenal: Mathieu Debuchy is in at right back for his first appearance since January, while Jack Wilshere is on the bench having been out since November. Wojciech Szczesny, reduced to the status of Arsenalâ€™s cup keeper, gets the nod in the nets. 4.32pm BST You will be watching ... Reading: Federici, Gunter, Hector, Pearce, Obita, McCleary, Williams, Chalobah, Robson-Kanu, Mackie, Pogrebnyak. Subs: Stephen Kelly, Norwood, Cox, Yakubu, Karacan, Andersen, Cooper. Arsenal: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs, Coquelin, Cazorla, Ramsey, Ozil, Sanchez, Welbeck. Subs: Gabriel, Wilshere, Giroud, Ospina, Walcott, Monreal, Flamini. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) Kieran Gibbs and Danny Welbeck walk out for the warm up prior to the match, both start for Arsenal. Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty Updated at 5.38pm BST 4.00pm BST What an FA Cup run Reading enjoyed back in 1927! The Biscuitmen, then as now a second-tier outfit, started in the first round against Southern League side Weymouth, with whom they shared eight goals. A 4-4 draw! And so a high-scoring pattern was set. Reading won the replay 5-0, then in the second round pipped Southend United by three goals to two. Next up was Manchester United, not yet established as one of the gameâ€™s giants, a First Division side in name but barely in ability during the inter-war years. After 1-1 and 2-2 draws, United were dispatched 2-1 in a second replay, Frank Richardson the goalscoring hero in each match. Portsmouth were ejected from the competition in the fourth round, 3-1. Brentford made way, 1-0, in the fifth. Then in the sixth round, Reading won 3-1 at Swansea Town. Theyâ€™d reached the semi-final stage for the first, and until this year the only, time! But the 1927 semi finals do not augur well for either Reading or Arsenal. Reading faced Cardiff City, and gamely attacked the First Division side, finalists two years previously, during the opening exchanges. They had the best of the first half hour, but Cardiffâ€™s defence held firm, and then Hughie Ferguson pounced as Pat McConnell dithered over a clearance. Harry Wake scored a second soon after, and the jig was up for Reading, who had taken 7,000 fans to Molineux, the majority wearing buttonhole badges in the shape of a biscuit, distributed gratis by local bakers Huntley & Palmers. Ferguson settled it with his second and Cardiffâ€™s third in the second half. The normally lethal Richardson barely had a sniff. Cardiff went on to face The Arsenal in the final, and look what happened there. Oh Arsenal, and your goalkeeper Dan Lewisâ€™s slippery jersey! When Reading were oop fâ€™coop No, the 1927 semi finals donâ€™t augur well for either Reading or Arsenal, one way or another. But theyâ€™re both in the semis again, and theyâ€™ll just have to get on with it. And hey, one of the pair has to win today, whatever happens, at the very least. Itâ€™s Readingâ€™s second semi-final appearance! Itâ€™s Arsenalâ€™s 28th! Itâ€™s David versus Goliath in the oldest, grandest and greatest cup competition of all! Itâ€™s on! Kick off: The traditional hour of 5.20pm. Another 12-goal cup classic, please!
Title:Kick It Out calls for collective action on social media abuse towards players
Date:2015-04-16
Content:An enormous volume of racist, homophobic, sexist and other discriminatory abuse of Premier League footballers and clubs on social media has been revealed in new research for the gameâ€™s anti-discrimination organisation, Kick It Out. The search of Twitter, Facebook, supportersâ€™ forums and blogs, using key abusive terms with playersâ€™ and club names, refined to identify direct abuse, found 134,400 discriminatory posts this season, from August 2014 to last month. The research has also highlighted the huge number of abusive posts received by some individual black players, finding that Mario Balotelli, of Liverpool, was sent more than 8,000 discriminatory posts on social media, of which more than half were racist. Danny Welbeck, who moved from Manchester United to Arsenal in September, received 1,700 abusive posts, exactly half involving racism. Daniel Sturridge was sent about 1,600 discriminatory posts, more than 60% abusing him on the grounds of sexual orientation. The research, conducted by Tempero, the social media management agency, and Brandwatch, a social intelligence and analytics company, found that 88% of those posting the abusive messages were on Twitter, 8% on Facebook, 3% on fansâ€™ forums and 1% on blogs. The five clubs, in order, receiving the most discriminatory abuse were Chelsea, who were the subject of 20,000 messages; Liverpool, 19,000; Arsenal, 12,000; Manchester United and Manchester City, with 11,000 each. The research also highlighted the matches that generated the most discriminatory messages, which mostly involved those clubs. The finding, that more than 134,000 discriminatory messages were sent in the first seven months of this season, potentially amounting to hate crime, has prompted Kick It Out to call for the football authorities, internet companies and police to form an expert panel that can collectively consider taking action. Roisin Wood, Kick It Outâ€™s chief executive, said the organisation is not satisfied with the response from the police to even the relatively small number, only 113 last season, which it referred to them from reports it received. Kick It Out has said it only received responses from the individual forces in 31 cases. Only nine reached a conclusion in which the offender was identified and action taken; one led to a prosecution and in two the young people involved agreed to undertake an education session to deter them repeating the discriminatory abuse. Wood argues that the internet companies also need to deal with abuse more strongly. â€œThis is a huge amount of awful abuse,â€? Wood said. â€œA lot of it is vile, and something needs to be done. We are really frustrated by the police response but we also understand that they cannot investigate all of this. We have to take it seriously and that is why we are inviting the relevant bodies and authorities to work together to find ways of addressing it.â€? Superintendent Paul Giannasi, of the National Police Chiefsâ€™ Council hate-crime working group, said he would welcome an invitation to be involved in the expert group addressing social media abuse in football. The Premier League said its clubs do report discriminatory abuse received by their players to relevant authorities and social media sites, and that the league would welcome further discussion on the action that can be taken. The Football Association said that as its disciplinary jurisdiction extends only to â€œparticipantsâ€? â€“ players, club staff and officials, not supporters â€“ it is not currently considering being involved in the proposed expert panel. The view within the FA is understood to be that if posts on social media are racist, homophobic and could constitute hate crime, the police are the appropriate body to deal with it. Kick It Outâ€™s reporting officer, Anna JÃ¶nsson, refers all reported incidents of alleged racist abuse to the policeâ€™s official hate crime reporting website, True Vision, which automatically passes them to police forces local to the person complaining. In the past year, only 4,169 hate-crime incidents of all kinds â€“ not restricted to social media â€“ were reported to the police via the True Vision website, a fraction of the total this research restricted to football has found. Giannasi said all are referred to local forces, who have a policy of recording incidents. Policing principles are that a response has to be â€œproportionateâ€? to an alleged crime and social media abuse is often considered difficult, given the anonymity that users usually adopt. The police do not nationally produce figures on forcesâ€™ response to alleged internet hate crimes reported via True Vision. â€œThe police do not routinely trawl the internet for hate material,â€? Gianassi said, â€œbut we are proactive in trying to find solutions to the problem. We work with industry partners and others to try to find solutions that balance the right to free speech with the need to protect individuals from targeted abuse.â€? Twitter believes it features highly on public research into social media abuse because, unlike Facebook, most of its interactions are public. Dick Costolo, Twitterâ€™s chief executive, was in February revealed to have told staff the company â€œsuck at dealing with abuse and trollsâ€? and has promised to strengthen its approach. A spokesperson told the Guardian: â€œAbuse is against our rules. We have recently made it easier to report, allowed people to report on behalf of others, and tripled the size of the team that handles these reports. There is still more to be done, by us and the industry as a whole, but we are working very hard to stop online abuse when it happens on our platform.â€? Wood said Kick It Out recognises the difficulties the police and internet companies have in dealing with such an extraordinary level of abuse, and said she hoped the expert panel may find â€œcreativeâ€? ways to address its prevalence in football. â€œWe do not want to criminalise young people and we offer education to them but people have to realise there are consequences. We recognise the police cannot investigate all of this; we may need creative solutions as well, such as a broader football education campaign,â€? she said.
Title:Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt quits after argument
Date:2015-04-16
Content:The Bayern Munich team doctor Hans-Wilhelm MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt and three other members of the medical team quit the club on Thursday saying they had been blamed for the Champions League defeat against Porto the previous night. The renowned MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt, who has worked at Bayern since 1977, released a statement saying: â€œAfter Bayern Munichâ€™s game in the Champions League against Porto ... the medical team were made responsible for the defeat.â€? The other three members walking out were MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrtâ€™s son, Kilian, as well as Peter Ueblacker and Lutz HÃ¤nsel. Related: Franz Beckenbauer lays into Dante following Bayernâ€™s collapse in Porto Bayern Munich seemed to be unaware of the development on Thursday night. â€œWe have not heard about this press release, so we canâ€™t comment on it,â€? said their press manager Markus HÃ¶rwick. MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt has quit once before, after a disagreement with JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann in 2008, but returned as soon as the former Tottenham player had left the club. Last season, MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt reportedly had a disagreement with Pep Guardiola over the treatment of the injured Thiago AlcÃ¢ntara. Bayern were missing several key players against Porto, including Franck RibÃ©ry, Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Javi MartÃ­nez and Medhi Benatia.
Title:The joys of 11-a-side amateur football (minus the finger up my bottom) | Max Rushden
Date:2015-04-17
Content:You can tell the importance of a knockout tournament by the number of words that precede the word â€œCupâ€?. The fewer, the more important. The World Cup. One word. World. On Saturday, my team Polytechnic 4s take on Winchmore Hill 5s in the final of The Institute of Sport, Exercise & Health Minor Cup â€“ the word â€œMinorâ€? really hammering home its insignificance. There will be more players than supporters. There will be rolling subs. There will be linesmen (a luxury at this level). There wonâ€™t be, however, any mind games â€“ but thatâ€™s mainly because we donâ€™t even have a manager to have the mind games. And there will be, for me as for so many other captains around the country at this time of the year, countless of dilemmas before kick-off. Stick with 4-4-2, or pack the midfield? How to cope without my first-choice centre-backs (a Mexican holiday and a tax accounting job in Jordan have put paid to their services)? Do I risk Jay with his broken ribs? And should I really have let Will wash the kit this week when he never arrives more than five minutes before kick-off? Related: Football Weekly Extra: JÃ¼rgen Klopp calls time in Dortmund Last night at 2am I was analysing how terribly I played at Parkonians last Saturday and worrying about who Iâ€™m going to leave on the bench for the final â€“ when surely I should be kept awake by more pressing matters: the Middle East, the point of voting Green, deciding whether to propose this summer, or if Iâ€™ll ever be competent enough to have kids. Twelve years into my Poly career, and my love for 11-a-side amateur football is as strong as ever. And without wanting to be cliched â€“ itâ€™s the people: your team-mates, your opponents, the officials, that make it, and make the stories that stick with you. From Femi â€“ an old strike partner, who presumed I had cramp when actually Iâ€™d done all the ligaments in my left ankle (that was a stretch I didnâ€™t need) â€“ to the referee who once threatened to book me for â€œstimulationâ€?, or the Kew midfielder who during a debate over whether heâ€™d elbowed one of my players announced: â€œWell I earn Â£250,000 a year so Iâ€™m fucking happy,â€? which didnâ€™t seem to answer the question. Or our left winger Ash, slipping 10 seconds into the game, going two-footed into their right-back, hitting his head on the floor, losing a contact lens and getting a migraine in the process, taking himself off, and straight home. Given how long Iâ€™ve played the game, I should be better at dealing with confrontation. In one game against Actonians, I was kicked all over the place by a large eastern European, Sergio I think, to the point where I snapped. I turned to him, glared and shouted: â€œIf you do that one more time, I will â€¦â€? and then nothing. I desperately thought of what Iâ€™d do; the silence was deafening. It was the emptiest of threats. Eventually I just wandered off to try to flick on another throw-in. Being kicked is one thing, but my strangest experience is altogether more disturbing. Coincidentally itâ€™s where our final is this year, Carshalton â€“ a neutral venue, which makes you feel a tiny bit like a professional footballer. It was two seasons ago, midway through the first half of league a game away at their fourth team. As I bustled past their skipper, and I donâ€™t know how to say this politely, he inserted one, or maybe two, fingers right up my bottom. I was confused. I know itâ€™s good to experience new things but I just wasnâ€™t prepared for this voyage of discovery. â€œWhat are you doing?â€? I inquired. â€œYou fucking love it mate,â€? was his carefully chosen response â€“ as the game carried on. The ref, like most amateur refs, was just doing his own thing in the centre circle. â€œLetâ€™s be clear,â€? I replied. â€œI really donâ€™t.â€? And even if I had, it just wasnâ€™t the place. That experience is perhaps not the best way to extol the virtues of amateur football, but it is a difficult one to forget. Related: Ten things to look out for in this weekend's football | Nick Ames and Paul Doyle Sadly, figures from last year suggest that the numbers of those who sign up and play week in week out in organised 11-a-side leagues are falling, with many choosing five-a-side instead. In the past five years more than 2,000 teams have disbanded, and the number of regular 11-a-side players (aged 16 or over) since 2005 has gone down by around 180,000 and that is a great shame. Too often the discussion about grassroots is about unearthing the next England team, which is important, but it should also encompass all levels and all ages. My club was founded in 1875. We have 12 sides. It costs around Â£53,000 a year for us to cover our costs (insert lazy comparison to weekly salary of reasonable Premier League player). Those costs are met solely by the players. Before petrol, beer and ankle tape I probably spend Â£400 a season. So it isnâ€™t cheap â€“ but Iâ€™ve found it one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, gaining friendships and experiencing the highs and lows that come with that. Last year we lost one of our squad to cancer. A tough-tackling centre-back, who occasionally marauded forward without any warning. Heâ€™d played for years before I arrived, until his retirement two years ago. But the old boys stay with the squad â€“ many others will be at the game on Saturday. At the funeral, there were 20 of us in Poly ties, one of his sons wore one as well, with the eulogies repeatedly mentioning his love for the club and the friends heâ€™d made there. And as well as the sadness, came reflection, and it made me realise that I really hadnâ€™t appreciated what a fundamental part of my life it had become. Max Rushden is a dirty target man.

Title:Uefa will not charge Real Madridâ€™s Dani Carvajal for alleged bite
Date:2015-04-15
Content:Uefa is not taking any action against the Real Madrid defender Dani Carvajal over allegations that he bit and punched the AtlÃ©tico forward Mario Mandzukic in Tuesdayâ€™s Champions League quarter-final, first leg. European footballâ€™s governing body said in a statement that proceedings had been opened against AtlÃ©tico over blocked stairways at the Vicente CalderÃ³n and a pitch invasion. Although it did not specifically mention the Carvajal incident, the statement added: â€œNo other disciplinary proceedings have been opened following the above-mentioned match.â€œ Uefa could not be immediately contacted for further comment. AtlÃ©tico Madridâ€™s captain, Gabi, had called on Uefa to act if there is evidence that Carvajal bit Mandzukic. Carvajal denied trying to bite the Croatia international on the arm. Footage published on social media showed Carvajalâ€™s mouth made contact with Mandzukicâ€™s arm as they tangled off the ball but it was impossible to tell conclusively if he had sunk his teeth into it. â€œSeeing after the match that I have been accused of biting a rival player I want to make it clear that I did not bite anyone, nor did I try to,â€? the Spain right-back told reporters.
Title:Tonbridge Angels physio Melvin Slight: fans deserve a say in their club
Date:2015-04-16
Content:Melvin Slight would not be the first unsung hero who never intended things to turn out this way. â€œI took my son down here for a trial when he was 12,â€? says the Tonbridge Angels physio. â€œI remember sitting with him in the car when we arrived, saying to him: â€˜Whatever you do, donâ€™t tell them I do any sort of physio work â€“ I donâ€™t want to get involved.â€™â€? That was 13 years ago, and â€œinvolvedâ€? does little justice to the extent of Slightâ€™s activities at the Ryman Premier League club since then. â€œImmersedâ€? would be a better description and his commitment has been recognised by his selection by Supporters Direct as one of its case studies for Supporter Ownership Week, which highlights some of the voluntary work being done by those at clubs that are owned by their fans. â€œIâ€™m a bit humbled by that,â€? says Slight. â€œIt was quite overwhelming. Iâ€™m the quiet type, really, and prefer to blend into the background. It was really nice to be singled out but this is just one of the things you do â€“ you donâ€™t seek the glory, and I really mean that.â€? Slight, who works full-time as an engineer, was singled out by Supporters Direct for his â€œenormous professionalism and dedicationâ€? as a volunteer. He had taken a Football Association physiotherapy course before becoming involved at Tonbridge, in order to assist his sonâ€™s team, and once the cat was let out of the bag he worked with the youth setup for four years before assuming first-team responsibilities. â€œIâ€™ve done all the follow-up courses and Iâ€™ve been happy to finance it myself,â€? he says. â€œItâ€™s cost me a few bob but I would never complain. Iâ€™m fortunate that Iâ€™m solvent so it doesnâ€™t really cause me a problem. The biggest thing is time, really â€“ when the season is kicking in youâ€™ve got training twice a week and one or two games as well. But I love it, Iâ€™ve met some good people down the years and this is a real family club â€“ one of those where youâ€™re either there for a short time or for years. â€œI look after the players as if they are mine, theyâ€™re a big part of my life; itâ€™s important they all come off the pitch safe and well, and giving them the right support during their rehabilitation is crucial too. You have to get them back to the right level but it can be very lonely sometimes and you need to be there for them.â€? That concern for othersâ€™ welfare extends to those at rival clubs, and the story of Slightâ€™s response to an emergency involving a Dorchester Town director last season has gained him admirers far beyond Kent. â€œIt was a strange one,â€? he says. â€œWeâ€™d just lost the game and one of our directors said: â€˜Could you come over, one of the guys from Dorchester has become unwell.â€™ When I got to him, we thought he might have been having a heart attack â€“ he wasnâ€™t well at all. I looked after him until the paramedics arrived and it turned out that he had an inner ear infection. But he was unable to get himself home from hospital so I told him to get in the car and drove him back. Weâ€™ve kept in touch since, heâ€™s someone I know in football, and he made the lovely gesture of donating some money to our club, which weâ€™ve put back in for medical supplies.â€? What Slight does not mention is that over 150 miles separate Tonbridge and Dorchester, and the round trip resulted in a 3am return home. He is not one to give up stories of his own heroism readily and prefers to see his recent recognition as symbolic of a collective achievement. â€œYou look at some of the others involved, like the guys from St John Ambulance â€“ those people are amazing, so dedicated and selfless, and Iâ€™m nothing compared to them,â€? he says. â€œThe praise Iâ€™ve had is really for everyone in football that does what I do. There are countless people in the background, hundreds, and football clubs would not survive without them. Even down to making a cup of tea for the visitors, they do these things and donâ€™t even realise the importance of it.â€? It is a prevalent attitude at Tonbridge, who were taken over by their fans last year in a process overseen by Supporters Direct. The club were relegated from the Conference South last season and have not had a straightforward time in the tier below, currently sitting 16th, but the bigger picture looks a far more secure one. â€œWe needed to do something like this, and weâ€™ve seen how well it has worked at clubs like AFC Wimbledon,â€? says Slight. â€œIt is still a bit of an unknown quantity but weâ€™ve seen the other side of it before â€“ weâ€™ve had big sponsors who have pumped in money but as soon as they fall out of love for the club then itâ€™s gone. We need to be on a sounder footing than that, and the supporters deserved a say. Itâ€™s their club, after all.â€? Slight, who says he feels far younger than his 55 years and runs several half-marathons a year in memory of Jack Maddams, a young Tonbridge player who died aged 17 as a result of a heart defect, has been a Tottenham supporter from a young age but admits that his first love â€“ and perhaps another, too â€“ has been usurped. â€œWhen people ask me who I support, I always say Tonbridge first â€“ thatâ€™s my club. My wife always says that if she put a blue Tonbridge Angels shirt on she might receive the attention they get there, and I think she might be right.â€?
Title:The Premier League managersâ€™ table: Garry Monk top and Manuel Pellegrini bottom | Paul Wilson
Date:2015-04-16
Content:This stage of the season, just before the FA Cup semi-finals and with the top and bottom placings in the Premier League still to be resolved, seems as good a time as any to look at which managers have enhanced their reputations over the last few months. Or the last few weeks in the cases of Dick Advocaat and Tim Sherwood. This is not a precise science. The league table at the end of the season ought to show exactly who has done well and who needs to do better, but while the table might never lie it does not always tell the full story. Last year, for example, the Premier League manager of the season did not actually win anything, did not even finish in the top half of the table, and you would be hard pressed to work out from the final standings alone why Tony Pulis was considered to have had a more impressive season than, say, Manuel Pellegrini or Brendan Rodgers. So purely as a hypothetical exercise before the actual gongs are handed out â€“ or the contract is terminated, whatever the case may be â€“ let us reorganise the league table a little in terms of managerial performance so far. The criterion here is improvement, both at a club level and a personal one. Which managers are sitting prettier now than they were at the start of the season, in other words. There is an enormous disparity within Premier League clubs in terms of finance, experience and aspiration, but based simply on whether supporters are happy with the way their season has gone or fed up with the bloke in charge it ought to be possible to draw up a ranking list. So here goes, starting from the top â€¦ 1 Garry Monk Has got to be the most enhanced managerial reputation because this time last year he had no managerial reputation. People feared he might be a the wrong choice or a suspiciously cheap one, yet with six games to go Swansea are sitting in their highest ever Premier League position, have matched their record points total, and have coped with losing their main striker. Impressive from a manager in his first full season. 2 Alan Pardew Many would argue the Crystal Palace manager ought to be in top spot, after a defining season that seems to have elevated him from the safe-pair-of-hands category to the go-to man for instant results. Clearly a good fit at Palace, and the much-quoted stat that reveals his points total for both his clubs this season stands at 51 would put a combined Newcastle-Palace above Swansea in the table. Related: Alan Pardew deserves credit, and not just for revival at Crystal Palace | Sean Ingle 3 ArsÃ¨ne Wenger Yes, above JosÃ© Mourinho. Arsenal have won their past eight matches in the league â€“ one more would equal a record set in their Invincible season â€“ and are in the last four of the FA Cup. European progress is still a problem and Chelsea are still favourites for the league, but the fans are not on Wengerâ€™s back any more. The manager has dug himself out of a hole (again) and should that ninth win in a row be achieved it could be even more interesting, because the opponents are Chelsea. 4 JosÃ© Mourinho Not doing anything particularly wrong, apart from going out of Europe at an unexpectedly early stage, but not pulling up many trees, either. This might be unfair on the manager who is top of the league but it is what happens when you set such brilliantly high standards for yourself. No one at Chelsea is moaning but a bit more excitement would not go amiss. Mourinho taking another title in his stride, along with the Capital One Cup, is simply what people expected. Par for the course. 5 Louis van Gaal Definitely an improvement on last season but much more important a huge improvement in the past few weeks on what was going on at Manchester United in the first half of the season. From chaos and confusion have come order, elegance and channelled excitement. United look better now than they did in the last couple of seasons under Sir Alex Ferguson. Money doubtless helps but how many other managers would have the bottle to leave Ã?ngel Di MarÃ­a and Radamel Falcao out of the side? 6 Ronald Koeman Remember the Southampton supporters refusing to buy season tickets at the start of the season? Enough said, and the Saintsâ€™ season could still get better. 7 Brendan Rodgers Still signs of tactical nous but unless Liverpool can squeeze into the top four not even winning the FA Cup would match last seasonâ€™s highs. Mario Balotelli, anyone? 8 Sean Dyche Little known outside east Lancashire this time last season, now Burnleyâ€™s manager is admired for producing gutsy performances every week from everyoneâ€™s second-favourite team. 9 Sam Allardyce Sorry, West Ham fans, but the table suggests you are still improving. Have a chat with a few Bolton supporters and be careful what you wish for. 10 Mauricio Pochettino Seems to have slotted easily into the Tottenham template, which is to do all right most of the time but nothing too dramatic or game-changing. Good work with Harry Kane, if saying so is all right with Tim Sherwood. 11 Mark Hughes Not quite pushed on this year as noticeably as he did last. Stoke probably need an inspired signing or two to climb out of their mid-table comfort zone. 12 Tim Sherwood Agreed, the number of games is too small a sample to be representative. And Aston Villa are not quite safe yet. But they are at Wembley this weekend, scoring goals at last and beginning to enjoy themselves. It may prove only to be a mini upturn, but upturn it is, so well done the new man. 13 Tony Pulis Could do no wrong last season and West Brom may have made the mistake of thinking his mere presence would keep them out of trouble. Still look likely to be safe but the last couple of results would blot any copybook. 14 Roberto MartÃ­nez Everton are no longer in relegation trouble, but the fact they were ever worried speaks volumes about their uneven season. Goodison faithful yet to be convinced MartÃ­nez can organise a defence or be trusted in the transfer market. 15 Nigel Pearson Spent much of the season digging a hole for himself, now showing signs he may be able to climb out. Leicester may, too, but they have left it very late. 16 Dick Advocaat Not bottom of this list because that would be rude when the guy has only just arrived in the country. Not enough games to judge, anyway, and Sunderlandâ€™s last two performances have been wildly inconsistent. 17 Steve Bruce Signed a new contract, photographed on the beach in the international break, Hull have not won in five games. Not looking great. 18 John Carver Probably not going to get the job permanently on the basis of what Newcastle have shown since Pardewâ€™s departure. That said, Newcastle could easily have taken a point or more from Anfield on Monday. 19 Chris Ramsey See above. Another nice guy in a difficult situation, but improvement from QPR? Only in the last couple of weeks and that might not be enough. 20 Manuel Pellegrini Related: Manchester City could sack Pellegrini before end of season if top-four spot in jeopardy Not a great week, not a great season. Manchester City will now be linked with JÃ¼rgen Klopp, or anyone else who becomes available, even as Pellegrini prepares to win the remaining six games that will ensure Champions League football next season, presumably for his successor. Improvement is Cityâ€™s buzzword and it has been conspicuous by its absence all season. Pellegrini is by no means the worst manager on this list but he took on the job with his eyes open and can see it has not gone to plan. When you dream big and spend big, when you fail you fail big.
Title:Vincent Kompany could miss rest of Manchester Cityâ€™s season
Date:2015-04-17
Content:Vincent Kompany may not play again this season for Manchester City with Manuel Pellegrini unsure how long the captain will be ruled out for. Wilfried Bony, GaÃ«l Clichy, Stevan Jovetic and James Milner will also miss Sundayâ€™s visit of West Ham United. The captain and central defender suffered the injury during Sundayâ€™s 4-2 derby defeat at Manchester United and was taken off at half-time. Pellegrini said: â€œHe has a muscle injury â€“ we donâ€™t know how long. We donâ€™t know if he will be fit before the end of the season.â€? Of his other injured players, the manager said: â€œJovetic, Bony, Clichy, Milner and Kompany are not fit for Sunday. [Dedryck] Boyata is fit â€“ he started working yesterday.â€? Pellegrini also defended Yaya TourÃ©, whose uneven form has drawn unwelcome attention. â€œYaya is a very important player for our team. All of you are waiting for me to criticise him but he will continue.â€? Cityâ€™s form has slumped since New Yearâ€™s Day, when they were joint top with Chelsea, to stand fourth. Pellegrini said: â€œItâ€™s more important than ever to have the fans, the players and the staff together as one. We are one club.â€? Asked if this was his most difficult spell since becoming manager, Pellegrini admitted it was his â€œworstâ€?. He said: â€œIt is the worst period in results because we lost the last four games we play away in Premier League and 2015 has been a very bad year. â€œLast year was more pressure when I arrive to the PL and we were fighting for the title.â€? Asked if he was hurt to hear other managers linked with his job, the Chilean said: â€œEvery time you manage an important club, not just here in Manchester City, in every big club, if you donâ€™t have the results the club deserves, everyone is talking to change the manager. Here, in Spain, in Italy, in other parts of the world so you must be used to the rumours but I trust a lot in the work I do. â€œOf course nobody is happy when you are out of the fight for the title. Maybe you cannot win the title every year but it is very easy to sack the manager. I donâ€™t think it is the correct diagnostic for every team.â€?
Title:Readingâ€™s Adam Federici backed by Steve Clarke after gift to Arsenal
Date:2015-04-18
Content:Steve Clarke offered his full support to Adam Federici, after the goalkeeper was left distraught by his glaring error in extra time that led to Readingâ€™s 2-1 FA Cup semi-final defeat against Arsenal. The 30-year-old Australian, who has been at the club since 2005, allowed Alexis SÃ¡nchezâ€™s low shot in the 105th minute to go through his legs and over the line, to effectively kill Readingâ€™s hopes of a first FA Cup final in their 144-year history. Federici had previously made good saves and none better than on 69 minutes, when he clawed the substitute Gabriel Paulistaâ€™s header up against the crossbar and out to safety. However, he was left in tears at the full-time whistle after his howler from Sanchezâ€™s effort. â€œThis is the life of a goalkeeper and Adam is a top goalkeeper,â€? Clarke, the Reading manager, said. â€œThereâ€™s every chance that he will be the Reading player of the season. His performances in the Championship have been absolutely crucial. We stick by him. We donâ€™t lose because of Adam. â€œEverybody supports him. Adam is a strong character as well. Heâ€™ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night, when we play Birmingham at home, heâ€™ll be as good as he always is.â€? The Reading striker Jamie Mackie said: â€œFederici has been our best player this season. If it wasnâ€™t for him, weâ€™d be in the bottom three. We win together and we lose together.â€? Clarke praised a â€œnear perfectâ€? performance from his team, while he highlighted a couple of dubious offside decisions, which pulled back Mackie and Pavel Pogrebnyak when they were clean through. He was upset, too, that Mathieu Debuchy was not penalised for a 66th-minute handball. â€œHis hand is out here and he stops the cross from going in,â€? Clarke said. â€œItâ€™s a penalty. These are the moments that you need in a game like this.â€? ArsÃ¨ne Wenger, who reported that Per Mertesacker had been forced off with an ankle injury that did not â€œlook too goodâ€?, could now become the firstÂ modern-day manager to win six FA Cups. â€œIn the end, we were a bit lucky because the keeper made a mistake and I can understand that he is distraught, but he kept them in the game for long periods,â€? Wenger said. â€œReading were ready to die on the pitch to go to this final and you have to congratulate them for the effort they put in.â€? Wenger said that he was unaware of Chelseaâ€™s 1-0 win over Manchester United, which moved them closer toÂ the Premier League title. When heÂ was told of the result, he said: â€œAh, 1-0. Usual.â€?
Title:JÃ¼rgen Klopp: â€˜Iâ€˜m not taking a sabbatical. I was no longer the perfect coach for Dortmundâ€™
Date:2015-04-15
Content:JÃ¼rgen Klopp has said that he asked to leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season as he â€œno longer feels he is the perfect coach for the clubâ€?. The 47-year-old confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that he had asked for his contract to be terminated but insisted that he is not tired and that he is not planning on having a sabbatical. In a very emotional press conference, with Klopp, the Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke, and the clubâ€™s sporting director, Michael Zorc, Klopp denied that he was quitting because of the poor results this season but rather because he felt that both club and he needed to move on. Related: JÃ¼rgen Klopp to leave Borussia Dortmund at end of season After Watzke had started by saying that this press conference was something they at the club had wished they would never have to do, Klopp said: â€œFirst of all, no one has to thank me. Both [me and the club] have given a lot and we have received a lot. But I have always said that the day I feel that I am no longer the perfect coach for this extraordinary club I will say that. â€œThat is something I have thought about in every phase here at Dortmund and decided in the last few weeks, days, that I was no longer able to be absolutely sure about that. And then, because of the unusual relationship I have with this club, the trust we have for each other, it was my duty to tell the club. â€œWe reached the decision together. You canâ€™t imagine how difficult it is when you have something so wonderful as here.â€? Klopp added that he was not suffering from exhaustion and that he would now use the rest of the season to ensure that Borussia finish as high up in the table as possible. They are currently 10th.

I am 0.0% tired,â€? he said. â€œI havenâ€™t had any contact with any other clubs but am not planning a sabbatical, though it could of course be that I have to take one, or whatever a free half-year is called, I donâ€™t know. I hadnâ€™t planned any of this [to quit] but it was just right that we announced this today so that the club can plan ahead. â€œWe were able to create a wonderful piece of history. Itâ€™s very unusual for a story to last seven years in football. I will miss every single person here and that feeling will only grow with time.â€?
Title:Bradford fire: the horrors and the silence that had to be broken | Daniel Taylor
Date:2015-04-18
Content:One day this week, Janice Lloyd showed me into the conservatory at her house a couple of miles north-west of Bradford and, before we had started to talk properly, she leaned forward in her seat and held out her arms to show how the goosebumps came up every time her mind went back to what she had seen. Janice was a policewoman on duty in Pontefract on the night of 11 May 1985 when the call came through that there had been a fire at Bradford Cityâ€™s ground and they needed help from outside the area. She was 19 and it seems almost inconceivable in todayâ€™s world that it was left to a teenager, barely out of school, to handle the hellish process of identifying the bodies. The rules were clearly different back then and Janice just blows out her cheeks at what she and another young constable, Clive Morgan, had to see. The girl from Pudsey had to grow up â€œovernightâ€?. She can remember how busy and chaotic it was at Bradford Central police station, yet also how eerily silent it was. â€œThis awful, deathly silence.â€? More than once, there are parts of our conversation when she stops to collect her breath. Janice was assigned as an unofficial family liaison officer, working 15-hour days despite not having a minute of bereavement training and it is a wonder that by the end of it she did not need her own counselling. One memory that will never leave her is of a grieving, desperate mother pulling out a school photograph of her youngest son. â€œA beautiful boy, lovely blue eyes, absolutely beautiful.â€? Andrew Fletcher was 11 years old, the youngest of the 56 to die. The next photograph was of the womanâ€™s husband, John. â€œI can remember it like it was yesterday,â€? Janice says. â€œShe looked at me and said: â€˜Theyâ€™ve not come home.â€™ And I knew what we had already seen at the stand earlier that day.â€? Andrew was buried in a coffin where the floral tributes included a football in Bradfordâ€™s claret and amber. Every so often, Janice will see those colours and the flashbacks start again. She talks of how incredibly hard it is to listen to Youâ€™ll Never Walk Alone because that was Bradfordâ€™s charity song and brings everything back. But more than anything, she remembers the first time she met that woman: Susan Fletcher. A widow at 34, Susan asked Janice if it would be possible to get her husbandâ€™s wedding ring. It wasnâ€™t. Andrewâ€™s uncle, Peter, and grandfather, Eddie, had to be identified by dental records. Susan wanted to see Andrew one last time but was told it was not a good idea. â€œRemember him as he was,â€? Janice told her. The horrors are unimaginable and the people of Bradford have had to live with them for so long it has not been easy to cover the story that Martin Fletcher, Susanâ€™s other son, has painstakingly put together about the fire and the revelations that there had been at least eight major fires at business premises either owned by or connected to the clubâ€™s former chairman, Stafford Heginbotham. In Bradford, there have always been people such as Patsy Hollinger, secretary of one of the main supportersâ€™ clubs in 1985, who have wanted this story out before now, manifesting itself in a series of graffiti attacks on Heginbothamâ€™s businesses. One of the people who has contacted Martin in the past few days did so to tell him his father was working as a painter and decorator at Tebro Toys, Heginbothamâ€™s company, before the blaze that ripped through the building in 1977. On the evening of the fire, his father always remembered Heginbotham telling him it â€œmight be best if he takes all his tools home as they might not be safe left in the buildingâ€?. Again, it can be put down to coincidence. All we can say for sure is that it was noteworthy enough for the son to get in touch. It is a hugely difficult, emotive subject and there are many who will passionately vouch for Heginbotham and argue that there must be an innocent explanation about the â€œmountain of coincidenceâ€? Fletcher reveals in his book, culminating in payouts worth around Â£27m in todayâ€™s terms. A significant number find it implausible to believe that 56 people died because Heginbotham, to quote what Susan once told her son, â€œwent back to the one thing he knew best that would get him out of trouble. I donâ€™t think Stafford intended for people to die. But people did.â€? Heginbotham died in 1995 and people generally donâ€™t like to speak ill of the dead. Plenty have told this correspondent that he handled the fire and its aftermath with tact and dignity. He is not short of character witnesses even if there is also the story about the memorial service at Valley Parade, two months after the fire, when a 12-year-old Martin and his relatives pulled up at traffic lights and heard a sound they had not heard all day â€“ laughter. â€œWe turned to the car alongside us and saw its occupants, including Stafford Heginbotham, all laughing away,â€? his book says. â€œGrandma, uncle Mike and aunty Val yelled through the open windows, wondering exactly what it was he had to be so happy about.â€? Other parts of the book bring in far more serious issues than the chairmanâ€™s public behaviour and it was certainly notable, visiting Hollinger in Bradford a few days ago, that he, like Fletcher, remembers Heginbotham telling Margaret Thatcher and the worldâ€™s media that the roof of the stand was due to be replaced the following day and that the steel girders were already being stored on the car park. â€œIt was all a lie,â€? Fletcher writes in 56 â€“ The Story of the Bradford Fire, quoting hard evidence from the official inquiry and identifying an aerial photograph of the cordoned-off site showing there was nothing of the kind. Hollinger, previously a groundsman at Valley Parade, brought up the exact same point. â€œI went up there, others went up there, and I asked people at the club, too. There wasnâ€™t even a nail.â€? That photograph of the smouldering site is at the top of this page. As Fletcher says: â€œThe only steel in that car park is on the cars themselves.â€? Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, has called for a new investigation, but can anyone blame Fletcher for having so little faith in the system? Just consider, as one small example, the opening address in the inquiry Justice Oliver Popplewell chaired over a mere five days and barely three weeks after the fire. â€œI must emphasise that this was a new club,â€? Andrew Collins QC said. â€œThere was wholly new management at the top.â€? What a way to start. Between them, Heginbotham and the vice-chairman, Jack Tordoff, had served 15 of the previous 20 years. Popplewell, and others, have now stated the timber stand had no insurance value and, again, is Fletcher wrong to feel like screaming in frustration? â€œAs was reported widely at the time, the club collected insurance proceeds of Â£500,000, with a further Football Grounds Improvement Trust grant of Â£375,000,â€? he says. Then we come to the former sports minister and proud Bradfordian, Gerry Sutcliffe. In 2011, Steve Rotheram, one of the prominent MPs in the Hillsborough campaign, became aware of Fletcherâ€™s story. He introduced him to his local MP, the shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, who told Fletcher he should meet Sutcliffe because â€œheâ€™s been around for years, heâ€™s a guy we all look up to, a former sports minister, Bradford through and through.â€? Fletcher loves his old city yet was dubious â€“ â€œthe people of Bradford donâ€™t want to know,â€? he said â€“ but he eventually sent Sutcliffe a 5,000-word cry for help. There was no reply. Follow-up emails were sent over the next three months. Rotheram was involved. Sutcliffe still did not reply. â€œIâ€™d always believed heâ€™d do nothing, but the extent of that nothing surprised even me,â€? Fletcher says. Sutcliffe tells me he has â€œno recollection of ever receiving any emailsâ€? and that is perplexing bearing in mind he has not disputed they were sent to the correct address. Sutcliffe has, however, swatted away the revelations as â€œspeculationâ€?. He made it sound like a summer transfer story. Do the people of Bradford want to know? Colin Butterworth, one of the heroes who pulled people out of that burning stand, tells me there is 85% to 90% support for Martin â€“ but that it is a silent majority. â€œI feel that deep down he feels that he is doing this for his father, brother, grandfather and uncle and the other 52 who perished in the fire.â€? Others have attacked him. They had not anticipated this before the 30th anniversary and, to put it in context, even the clubâ€™s fanzine, The City Gent, has for the most part taken a decision not to write, or ask questions, about the fire. Fletcher has broken what he calls â€œa code of silenceâ€? but it makes you despair when Twitterâ€™s cesspit would like us to believe the poor kid (Andrew, his little brother, would have turned 41 on Saturday) is doing this for money. Fletcher has lost around Â£250,000 in earnings from sacrificing his career as a chartered accountant. He is also one of the more prominent fundraisers for the Bradford Burns Unit. That side of it has been unpleasant in the extreme. But then I think of the policewoman who was assigned to the Fletchers, at the age of 19, and her kindness is reassuring. Janice has kept in touch with the family and will be meeting Martin for a drink in a week or two. â€œHe was a tower of strength for his mum,â€? she told me. â€œIâ€™ll never forget. He was like a grown-up. Twelve years old, yet having to be an adult.â€? Janice held up her arm again to show her goosebumps. Whatever happens next, she said, that will never change.
Title:Newcastle United v Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League â€“ as it happened
Date:2015-04-19
Content:6.08pm BST So, the extremes available to both teams â€“ Champions League and Championship â€“ have edged a little closer after Spurs won in style. Newcastle did not play like a team in freefall, but the final score doesnâ€™t lie, and once Eriksen had restored Spursâ€™ lead, the game was effectively over. In almost every department, the visitors were superior. The game, fleetingly entertaining as it was, felt like a sideshow on another afternoon of unrest on Tyneside. The official (and clearly exaggerated) attendance today was 47,427 â€“ the clubâ€™s lowest home crowd of the season, and still the biggest crowd to attend a game in England this weekend. Despite the empty seats, the Sunderland banner, the branded Ashley Out vans and John Carverâ€™s changes, the afternoon ended predictably, in defeat. With a reasonable run-in, and breathing space below them, they still should just about stay up. Where they go from here, though, is anyoneâ€™s guess. Thanks a lot for joining me. Bye! 5.51pm BST FT: Newcastle 1-3 Tottenham Thatâ€™s your lot. Spurs climb to sixth; Newcastle lose their sixth league game on the spin. You might think with nobody left in the ground, there wouldnâ€™t be booing. Youâ€™d be wrong. 5.50pm BST 90 mins: Three minutes of injury time, although they wonâ€™t be seen by the thousands who headed for the exit as soon as Kane scored. 5.49pm BST GOAL! Newcastle 1-3 Tottenham (Kane) ...and from the break, they end the game, with Lamela dribbling straight down the middle, before slipping the ball through to Kane. Heâ€™s beyond the last defender, one-on-one with Krul, and rolls the ball into the far corner. Drought over. Harry Kane scores the third. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty Images Updated at 5.59pm BST 5.47pm BST 89 mins: Bar the Colback goal, Carverâ€™s changes havenâ€™t helped Newcastle, who are now forced into going long to bypass the midfield, despite a lack of height up front. They pile forward for a long hoof from Krul, but the ball wonâ€™t drop, and Spurs can break... 5.45pm BST 87 mins: Ryan Taylorâ€™s long ball is nodded away, but only as far as Janmaat, who controls the ball on his chest before sending a volley high over the bar. Newcastle running out of time. 5.44pm BST 86 mins: Spurs again have numbers forward, but Dierâ€™s attempted through pass to Kane is sloppy, and Newcastle can break. Bentaleb does whatâ€™s required, hauling down Cabella and earning a booking. Ryan Mason is on, in place of Paulinho. 5.43pm BST 84 mins: Spurs look a touch panicked whenever the ballâ€™s in their final third, as theyâ€™re forced to remember they only lead by a goal. From a free-kick some 35 yards out, Taylor pings a low diagonal ball towards Perez, but for the first time today, the striker miscues, and the ball rolls away for a goal kick. 5.40pm BST 82 mins: Kane, looking at a third straight game without scoring, earns a corner, which Fazio heads out of Krulâ€™s gloves. Thereâ€™s no whistle â€“ thankfully for Newcastle, the header bounces wide. 5.38pm BST 80 mins: Cabella has faded from view in the second half, but he picks up the ball on the left and feeds Taylor, who slots the ball to Janmaat. The full-back takes aim from 30 yards out, and sends a respectable effort over Michel Vormâ€™s goal. 5.36pm BST 78 mins: Rose is flagged offside to end a promising Spurs passing move. Pochettino makes his first change, with Moussa Dembele replacing Chadli. 5.34pm BST 76 mins: More sterling work from Janmaat down the right side, and his low ball into the box is just out of Colbackâ€™s reach. Spurs spring forward, and Kane shoots at Krul with Lamela hollering at the England man for a pass. 5.32pm BST 74 mins: Spurs are starting to stretch the Newcastle back line, and Bentaleb, perhaps the standout performer in midfield today, finds Lamela with a dangerous diagonal pass â€“ but Krul is out smartly to save his low shot. A final change for Newcastle, with young forward Adam Armstrong on in place on Anita. 5.30pm BST 72 mins: Bentaleb scoops the ball over the Newcastle back line and into the path of Kane, who loses his balance near the right touchline, with team-mates arriving in the middle. 5.28pm BST 69 mins: Newcastle force a couple of corners, with Rose intercepting Anitaâ€™s cross on the second to clear the danger. Itâ€™s subdued inside St. Jamesâ€™ Park â€“ a reflection of the fans not wanting to turn on the players, or a sign that John Carver is harder to hurl abuse at than Alan Pardew? 5.25pm BST 67 mins: Tim Krul is having an odd afternoon. From the corner, he somehow repels a Kane volley from six yards out. It looked like a combination of hands, face and neck that kept it out, with Anita on the line to prod the rebound away. Iâ€™ve no idea how that didnâ€™t go in. Tim Krul makes a clearance save from a Tottenham Hotspur corner. Photograph: Richard Lee/BPI/Rex Shutterstock Updated at 5.43pm BST 5.23pm BST 66 mins: The Eriksen goal has proved something of a sucker punch for Newcastle, and Spurs are making most of the running now. Kane finds a pocket of space to the left of Krulâ€™s goal, but delays the pass, and has to settle for a corner. 5.22pm BST 64 mins: More Spurs possession, although Newcastle are at least chasing with gusto, spurred on by the home crowd. Kane almost gets away from Williamson with a neat bit of ball-juggling, but the defender keeps him at bay. Harry Kane marked by Michael Williamson. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty Images Updated at 5.42pm BST 5.20pm BST 61 mins: After a short, unexplained delay, Ryan Taylor lifts the ball in, it finds its way to Perez, but the Spanish strikerâ€™s shot from an angle is blocked. Spurs look to break, Cabella checks Lamela, and gets a booking. Taking one for the team, we call that. 5.18pm BST 59 mins: Janmaat, tight to the right touchline, finds Perez, who flicks the ball away from Verthongen, in the direction of Obertan. The Belgian doesnâ€™t stand a chance, and upends Perez, picking up a yellow card in the process. Dangerous free kick for Newcastle, here. 5.15pm BST 56 mins: Kane, again working the channels, sees his cross towards Eriksen flicked to safety by Coloccini. There is then a prolonged lull, allowing for several super slow-mo replays of the second Spurs goal. The verdict: Eriksenâ€™s goal. 5.12pm BST 54 mins: Spurs look to turn the screw, with Chadli finding Bentaleb with a terrific, dipping cross from the left. Bentaleb heads over from eight yards out, when he should hit the target, particularly given Krulâ€™s game so far. 5.10pm BST GOAL! Newcastle 1-2 Tottenham (Eriksen) ...and he scores! The ball in is excellent, skimming over the heads of several players, arriving late in Krulâ€™s field of vision. The goalkeeper gets a hand to it, but can only push it meekly into the corner. It appears the ball passed through without anyone getting a touch, and itâ€™s Eriksen who celebrates. Tim Krul concedes Tottenhamâ€™s second goal scored by Christian Eriksen.

Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty Images Updated at 5.27pm BST 5.09pm BST 51 mins: Eriksen is trying to exploit the extra space in Newcastleâ€™s midfield, and heâ€™s brought down by Colback, who had a fistful of the Daneâ€™s shirt. Heâ€™s already been booked, and needs to calm it down a touch. Eriksen lines up the free-kick on the left flank... 5.06pm BST 49 mins: Spurs again keep the ball neatly in the Newcastle half, before Eriksen embarks on an ill-advised run through the middle, before losing the ball. A terrible start to the second half, after an opening period where they led without doing very much. Updated at 5.08pm BST 5.03pm BST GOAL! Newcastle 1-1 Tottenham (Colback) The changes worked, evidently. Carver changes to a 4-4-2, and it pays off within fifteen seconds! Janmaat finds space on the right and slips a pass to Perez, who looks offside. Thereâ€™s no flag, he turns Vertonghen before his pass is cut out by Dier â€“ but the rebound falls to Jack Colback, who sweeps it inside the near post! Updated at 5.05pm BST 5.02pm BST Changes: Gabriel Obertan and Sammy Ameobi are on, in place of Abeid and Gouffran. The second half is underway... now. Updated at 5.03pm BST 4.54pm BST Itâ€™s just finished Aston Villa 2-1 Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. Tim Sherwoodâ€™s going to the Cup Final! Incidentally, if Villa win the Cup, they will take a Europa League place; if Arsenal win, and qualify for the Champions League, the cup winnersâ€™ spot will go to the seventh placed team, not the runners up. News that may be of interest to Spurs fans, Iâ€™d imagine. Updated at 5.00pm BST 4.48pm BST HT: Newcastle 0-1 Tottenham The home fans who have turned up are booing. That about sums it up. 4.47pm BST 45 mins: Another booking for Spurs, with Lamela rightly booked for a reckless, and rather pointless, foul on Anita by the Newcastle goalline. One added minute. 4.45pm BST 43 mins: Harry Kane has been lurking with intent on the fringes so far, and from a decent crossing position on the left, he tests Krul, who this time is equal to the stinging shot. Paulinho is booked for a foul on Cabella in the previous Newcastle attack. 4.44pm BST 41 mins: Newcastle edge upfield, with Cabella fending off challenges before finding Gouffran. The Frenchmanâ€™s slipped pass finds Colback, who is challenged by Fazio. Another silky move from Newcastle, but why exactly was Jack Colback the furthest player upfield? 4.41pm BST 40 mins: Colback has tested Kevin Friendâ€™s patience one too many times, and goes in the book after another clumsy challenge. Hereâ€™s Gary Naylor to kick Newcastle while theyâ€™re down: 4.40pm BST 38 mins: Perez looks like a player who can create a goal out of nowhere, and how Newcastle need that. The 21-year-old tests Vorm again with a curling shot from 25 yards out. Plenty of quality, if little real threat, from the Newcastle front line so far. Updated at 4.40pm BST 4.38pm BST 34 mins: Spurs continue to find things easy in possession, until Perez dispossesses Verthongen, winning a free kick in the process. Newcastle give the ball straight back, with Dier seeking out Kane with a lofted ball down the right â€“ but Kane is flagged offside. Hereâ€™s an impossibly exotic email from Mick Cathcart: â€œSince you seem a bit short of company, I thought Iâ€™d break the habit of a lifetime and get in touch. Iâ€™m following you through a steam-age dial-up connection in Lhasa, Tibet routed through a VPN in Berkshire. Tell me, how empty is the ground? How many people have actually had the bottle to stay away? I stopped going last year and wonâ€™t go back until that man no longer owns my club...â€? There are plenty of empty seats, Mick, but there are enough fans in the ground to cover it. Itâ€™s more FA Cup third round day than visible, organised protest. Updated at 4.46pm BST 4.33pm BST 31 mins: That had actually been a decent half-hour for Newcastle, but then their entire team, including Krul, stopped playing for thirty seconds. You canâ€™t do that. Spurs, buoyed by the goal, charge forward, with Colback bringing down a rampaging Danny Rose, and earning a talking to from Kevin Friend. 4.31pm BST GOAL! Newcastle 0-1 Tottenham (Chadli) Gouffran, trying to hold the ball up in his own half, is crowded out, and Nacer Chadli picks it up. The midfielder runs unopposed to the edge of the area, and hits a firm shot that beats Tim Krul at the near post. Nacer Chadli scores the first. Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images Updated at 4.49pm BST 4.29pm BST 28 mins: Cabella, who has looked the most likely to make something happen, offers up a curling right-footed cross from the left which just evades Gouffran. 4.28pm BST 26 mins: Newcastle win a free-kick practically in the corner quadrant, next to a particularly empty corner of the ground. Ryan Taylor puts in a dangerous ball, and Williamson meets it, but under pressure from Vertonghen he can only head over. 4.26pm BST 24 mins: Now Newcastle try stringing a few passes together, with Perez holding up play smartly, before finding Colback on the left. All three forwards are in the area, but Colback doesnâ€™t know that, because he doesnâ€™t look up, and beams the ball over the lot of them. Updated at 4.28pm BST 4.24pm BST 22 mins: Spurs have a bash at a counter-attack themselves, with Kane finding Eriksen, who sets off down the left. His cross bounces up for Paulinho, but the Brazilian tries to feed the ball through to Lamela, rather than take a shot himself. Lamela stretches, but canâ€™t reach it. 4.23pm BST 20 mins: The game is settling into a pattern, with Newcastleâ€™s front three looking to hit Spurs on the break. 63% possession for the visitors thus far, but another half-chance for the hosts, as Cabella tries to hit Gouffranâ€™s looping cross first time, but sees it deflected into Vormâ€™s arms. 4.21pm BST 18 mins: Spurs have plenty of time and space in midfield to stroke the ball around, and another neat move ends with Paulinho blazing over from 25 yards out. That banner, though. I think the Premier League season has just reached a new low. 4.19pm BST 16 mins: HERE COMES THE BANNER! Due to its small size and the lack of noise inside St. Jamesâ€™ Park, I think more people heard the plane than saw its provocative cargo. Underwhelming on all counts. Photograph: TV 4.16pm BST 14 mins: This has actually been a lively start, all things considered. The hosts get the best chance of the match, with Gouffran picking out Perez, who sidefoots the ball straight at Vorm. That was a presentable chance. 4.15pm BST 12 mins: Spurs respond in kind, with Danny Rose scampering down the left wing and collecting Kaneâ€™s through ball, before drilling a low ball right across the six-yard box. It is just about cleared, before Rose is flagged offside from the follow-up. 4.14pm BST 11 mins: Ayoze Perez, looking very much alone despite playing in a nominal front three, chases after Anitaâ€™s through ball, but is flagged offside. He wasnâ€™t, and would likely have got there ahead of Vorm. A let-off for Spurs. 4.11pm BST 9 mins: Cabella seeks out Perez with a raking forward pass, but Dier is across to cover. At the other end, Lamela overruns the ball with team-mates available. The atmosphere is strange. 4.09pm BST 7 mins: After a spell of, letâ€™s say, casual stuff, Harry Kane is felled by Vurnon Anita, playing at left-back today. Anita that is, not Kane. It looked accidental, but Anitaâ€™s arm caught Kane, and he needs treatment before returning to the field. 4.06pm BST 4 mins: Cabella, playing alongside Perez and Gouffran up front, makes the first in-roads for the hosts with a darting run down the left. His low ball just evades Gouffran, lurking on the edge of the area. Meanwhile, it seems Jonas Gutierrez, left out of the matchday squad today, was available to play, and doesnâ€™t mind who knows it... 4.04pm BST 2 mins: Total control from the visitors so far, with Coloccini getting across to block off a Harry Kane run, conceding a corner, which comes to nothing. The away fans are audible from up high, although they donâ€™t have to try too hard. 4.00pm BST Peep Here we go, then. St. Jamesâ€™ has filled up considerably ahead of kick-off, although there are still swathes of empty seats. Newcastle are in black and white, with Spurs in yellow. 3.55pm BST Five minutes or so until kick-off. You wouldnâ€™t want to be in John Carverâ€™s shoes today, but Spurs fan Peter Crosby has some soothing words for the Newcastle head coach: â€œWhen youâ€™ve lost five games in a row, your fans are protesting, you have a struggling rookie manager, youâ€™re in danger of slipping into a relegation battle, and the future looks bleak, never fear â€“ weâ€™ll be happy to get your season back on track with an obligingly brittle performance and the gift of three precious points.â€? 3.45pm BST Certainly plenty of evidence of the Ashley Out campaign around the ground â€“ no word yet on whether it will greatly affect the attendance inside St. Jamesâ€™ Park, although it looks pretty sparse with 15 minutes until kick-off. Word has it that Sunderland fans are planning to fly a banner over a potentially half-empty ground today, celebrating five straight derby victories. Not the time, guys. Newcastle fans protest outside Shearerâ€™s, I mean â€˜Nineâ€™ ahead of the game. Updated at 3.49pm BST 3.21pm BST The managers have surfaced for some pre-match chat. John Carver is pleased to welcome back Fabricio Coloccini, and said Newcastle â€œalmost look like a senior football sideâ€? with players returning from injury. Faint praise if ever I heard it. Mauricio Pochettino took the opportunity to play down the changes made after the home defeat to Aston Villa, and to join Carver in calling, not entirely convincingly, for six wins out of six to finish the season. Updated at 3.21pm BST 3.09pm BST Team news Two changes for Newcastle, as Fabricio Coloccini returns after a three-game ban, while Moussa Sissoko starts a two-game suspension of his own. Yoan Gouffran also comes into the team, in place of Gabriel Obertan. Itâ€™s evolution, not revolution, for Mauricio Pochettino, with three changes from the team that lost to Aston Villa. Jan Vertonghen returns in defence and takes the captainâ€™s armband back from Kane, while Paulinho replaces Mason and Lamela comes in for Andros Townsend. Newcastle United: Krul; Janmaat, Williamson, Coloccini (c), Anita; Abeid, R Taylor, Colback; Cabella, Gouffran, Perez. Subs: Woodman, Obertan, Ameobi, Riviere, Armstrong, Kemen, Sterry. Tottenham Hotspur: Vorm; Dier, Fazio, Vertonghen (c), Rose, Paulinho, Bentaleb; Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli; Kane. Subs: Friedel, Soldado, Yedlin, Townsend, Dembele, Davies, Mason. Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire) Updated at 3.34pm BST 3.00pm BST Preamble Hello. Newcastle and Spurs, two teams usually front and centre when the high farce is handed out, have done their best to avoid any drama this season, yet both sets of players find themselves kicking their heels at Gatwick, somehow with something still to play for. Sort of. Newcastle signed off for the season in January, when Alan Pardew fled to Palace and poor John Carver was handed the keys. After five straight defeats, they are mired on 35 points with a lengthy list of absentees, and could still go down. Theoretically. Spurs, meanwhile, have run into a poor patch of form that even Harry Kane canâ€™t solve. Kane has got the traditional dip in form in early after his England debut, and Mauricio Pochettino has noticed. As things stand, victory for Spurs would leave them seven points behind Manchester City in fourth, and still in the Champions League race. Technically. To spice things up, Newcastle fans are calling for a boycott of todayâ€™s game, in the latest protest aimed squarely at the back of Mike Ashleyâ€™s head. Several season ticket holders are set to feed the ducks in Leazes Park rather than watch the match. Fans not going to the game, but still paying, sounds like something Ashley would dream up in a late-night strategy meeting, but good luck to them. Kick-off is at 4pm BST, team news to follow.
Title:Ross Barkley penalty miss sums up strange season for cavalier Everton
Date:2015-04-19
Content:There used to be certainties in Evertonian life. Leighton Baines would take the penalties and Baines would score the penalties. Now it seems Everton have entered an era of illogical unpredictability. They have been awarded five spot kicks in 2015. Baines has taken none. Romelu Lukaku has scored three out of three, but Kevin Mirallas, who scored the only goal of the game here, and Ross Barkley have missed once apiece, both at 0-0 in vital home matches. It required an outstanding save from Burnleyâ€™s Tom Heaton to deny the Englishman, but goalkeeping brilliance is no explanation for Evertonâ€™s curiously cavalier attitude. Their manager, Roberto MartÃ­nez, spoke of being able to plump from several expert spot-kick takers, yet the sole penalty Barkley has scored in his senior career was for Sheffield Wednesday against Bolton Wanderers in 2012. Perhaps, given a record of excellence from 12 yards that includes 15 conversions from 16 attempts, the laid-back Baines ought to be more demanding. The sense of strangeness about the situation is in keeping with Barkleyâ€™s status as the Evertonian enigma. â€œWe have an incredible character who can become a great, great player,â€? said MartÃ­nez, who said in November that the 21-year-old would become the finest English player ever. That Barkley was booed at Goodison Park two months later indicates that a much-touted talent is yet to convince many. Perhaps his most auspicious display of the campaign was a bright cameo for England in Italy, rather than anything he has produced in an Everton shirt. The midfielder has been compared to Paul Gascoigne and Michael Ballack by MartÃ­nez, valued at Â£50m by Everton and yet Kieran Trippier, the right-back of a Burnley team who prop up the division, has created four times as many goals this season. Barkleyâ€™s Premier League career has still yielded only eight goals and one assist, and an opportunity for a statistic-inflating set piece was squandered. Perhaps only MartÃ­nez, who has an ability to draw a positive from any situation, could derive such satisfaction from seeing one of his charges fail. â€œOnce you win the game and you can look back at that incident, Iâ€™m happier that he missed it because as an experience it doesnâ€™t get any better than wanting to take the responsibility,â€? he said. If the theory is that adversity is a great educator, given the tone and tenor of underwhelming Evertonâ€™s year, Barkley ought to have absorbed much. â€œHe has learned massively from this demanding season,â€? MartÃ­nez added. â€œHe comes from a World Cup, then all of a sudden he has found expectations, responsibility and an interesting learning curve. He never allowed his standards to drop.â€? Others might beg to disagree; Barkley seems to have suffered an acute case of second-season syndrome. The Spaniardâ€™s upbeat rhetoric tends to jar with realists in a year of high aims and low achievement. Barkley has been outscored by the centre-back Phil Jagielka, dropped for more prosaic talents and shunted out to the flanks. His ball-carrying ability was apparent in his preferred central role particularly, his manager argued, after the setback of his 10th-minute spot kick. â€œI was extremely impressed in the manner that he took responsibility: working for the team, doing his job, showing for the ball,â€? MartÃ­nez said. â€œThe bravery of Ross Barkley is to get on the ball and always be available. I think today we got a better player after that display because of the experience of the penalty.â€? Yet if the emergence of a local prodigy prompts thoughts of exponential improvement, there is an unpromising precedent. Jack Rodwell was a homegrown talent who did not develop quickly enough. He became more of an asset on the balance sheet than the football pitch. Ultimately his sale to Manchester City, given the canny way David Moyes used the proceeds, proved more beneficial than his presence at Everton. History provides warnings for a player expected to have a bright future. To Barkleyâ€™s right on Saturday was Aaron Lennon, excellent against Burnley and enjoying a personal renaissance, but yet to realise the potential he displayed as the teenage breakout star of an earlier England World Cup campaign. â€œHe is quite a unique player,â€? MartÃ­nez said, again displaying his capacity for extravagant praise. Man of the match Leighton Baines (Everton)
Title:West Brom prove perfect fit for Tony Pulisâ€™ style in defeat of Crystal Palace
Date:2015-04-19
Content:Tony Pulis has always been a manager of habits. He arrived and departed from Selhurst Park on Saturday wearing a tailored suit, having masterminded West Bromwich Albionâ€™s victory over his former employers in his familiar shellsuit and club-crested cap. â€œIâ€™ll leave it for all the sophisticated lads,â€? said Pulis when asked if he has ever considered changing his obligatory touchline uniform to something smarter. â€œIâ€™ve always done it, from my days at Bournemouth. I donâ€™t see a reason to change. Iâ€™d never take my cap off during a game. â€œI watched the first game for Albion and sat upstairs in a suit. I came down after 10 minutes because Iâ€™d had enough of sitting there. Thatâ€™s just the way I am. I want to be close to the action.â€? Guiding another team to Premier League safety in the age of multi-billion-pound TV deals is another reason for him never to change his successful formula. Against the manager who walked out on them 48 hours before the opening day of the season, Palaceâ€™s attempt to match last seasonâ€™s feat of five successive victories under Pulis was thwarted inside the opening two minutes when a textbook corner routine was converted by James Morrison. From that point, the current manager, Alan Pardew, admitted his team were always going to struggle to break down a well-drilled defence led by Joleon Lescott. Some industrial challenges on the hostsâ€™ creative sparks Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha went unpunished by the referee Jon Moss but Craig Gardnerâ€™s brilliant strike meant Pulis could enjoy his day in the sun, shielded by his cap of course. Victory all but assures West Brom a sixth successive season in the Premier League, although their head coach â€“ to give Pulis his official title â€“ is taking nothing for granted with matches against Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United still to come. â€œIâ€™m not sure how many points weâ€™ll need,â€? he said. â€œWeâ€™ve talked about 40 points all season but there was a lot of talk on social media and other places that 33 might be enough and you can become complacent. Weâ€™re not good enough as a football club to become complacent at this level.â€? Pardew could only acknowledge that he had been outmanoeuvred by his predecessor. Jason Puncheon struggled to have his usual effect on the game in a deeper central midfield role, while the captain Mile Jedinak was withdrawn at half-time on his first appearance at Selhurst Park since the Boxing Day defeat against Southampton that prompted Neil Warnockâ€™s sacking. The remarkable transformation since then under Pardew means a top-half finish remains a possibility, although much will probably rest on Saturdayâ€™s home match against Hull, given his side also have yet to play Liverpool, Chelsea and United. â€œOf course we regroup now, try to attack Hull as best we can and get a result,â€? he said. â€œItâ€™s a disappointing result for us, a disappointing result on the back of many good days. Thatâ€™s football. We were committed, we tried a few things that didnâ€™t work. We tried a few things that did work. Weâ€™ll take the negatives and positives out of the game. â€œWhen weâ€™ve had setbacks weâ€™ve really bounced back well. Now we have another one and we need to bounce back again. Iâ€™ve no doubt we will.â€? Pulis was named Premier League manager of the year for his part in guiding Palace to 11th place last season, after taking over in December with the club struggling in the relegation zone. Pardew could also be a contender for the prize he won in 2012 with Newcastle, having arrived with Palace in a similar predicament and earning 25 points from 13 matches since returning to south London. â€œWeâ€™ve played above ourselves at times since Iâ€™ve been here. Theyâ€™re a terrific group to manage,â€? he said. â€œWeâ€™re not a top team where we can dominate and expect a result like you could at Man City or United at home. We have to really focus and concentrate. We have weaknesses we try to cover and strengths to build on and thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll continue to do. Standing here Iâ€™m really proud of the players. They should be proud of their season.â€? Man of the match Joleon Lescott (West Brom)
Title:Mourinho: I told Hazard it was a game Chelsea will never lose â€“ he complied
Date:2015-04-19
Content:It said much for the way JosÃ© Mourinhoâ€™s afternoon had panned out that, when reflecting on a grind of a victory over Manchester United that leaves Chelsea two matches from the title, he was still pinpointing his most anxious moment of Saturday as having come around eight hours before kick-off â€“ and in the lobby of the teamâ€™s waterfront hotel. The manager had ambled down to breakfast, content in his weekâ€™s tactical preparations in which Ruben Loftus-Cheek filled in as Unitedâ€™s Marouane Fellaini back at Cobham to ensure Kurt Zouma was battle ready for the contest ahead. Then Mourinho bumped into the concierge to be told the Belgian could not be involved as he had just introduced himself at the front desk, dressed in jeans and having his picture taken with guests, and announced himself as â€œIâ€™m Fellainiâ€? to collect a pair of match tickets left for him by Eden Hazard. The Portugueseâ€™s first reaction was to be dumbstruck, albeit the silence quickly gave way to rather more colourful language, given a week of drills specifically designed to render this match â€œ10 versus 10â€? had apparently gone to waste. Once the initial panic had subsided, his second was to reach for his smartphone and Google images of Fellainiâ€™s brother, Mansour. â€œI said to the doorman, â€˜Was it this one who was here?â€™ and he pointed to the man who had come in,â€? said Mourinho. â€œHa, heâ€™s the brother.â€™â€? That was about as jittery as it got. United may have dominated the ball at Stamford Bridge but Chelsea were largely content to let them operate at armâ€™s length. Pragmatism has been prioritised of late, with rigid tactical diligence and discipline ensuring the lead established by the dazzling displays that had illuminated the first half of the season will not be lost. Louis van Gaalâ€™s visitors were bright and energetic, hogging the ball and menacing up to the six-yard box, but the hosts are experts at drawing the sting from high-calibre opponents. This side have not lost a league game to United, Manchester City, Arsenal or Liverpool since Mourinho returned to English football in 2013. Arsenal will need to wreck that record next Sunday if the title race is to be prolonged, in name only, into May but the management will presumably have another plan afoot to nullify Alexis SÃ¡nchez, Mesut Ã–zil and co. Fellaini, such a menace of late during Unitedâ€™s fine run, was suffocated by Zouma and, in Hazard, Chelsea had their own Belgian to wreak havoc. Where Cesc FÃ bregas and Diego Costa have excelled for periods this season, it is the 24-year-old playmaker who has consistently offered the leaders their forward propulsion. Hazard is a genius, a player capable of weaving through the clutter in possession to offer urgency and incision to a team that can, otherwise, lack invention against stubborn defence. His movement and speed of delivery ups the entire teamâ€™s tempo. â€œHe makes the difference,â€? said Branislav Ivanovic. â€œHe gets kicked but never complains, works so hard all the time and is improving massively. He is flying. Give him the ball and he will do everything. Sometimes he looks like he is not from this world.â€? Next Sunday his fellow professionals may vote him the best in the country when the Professional Footballersâ€™ Association gathers for its annual awards evening. Memories will be fresh of his burst on to Oscarâ€™s backheel, United momentarily distracted as they appealed for a foul by John Terry on Radamel Falcao, with Hazardâ€™s clipped finish squeezed through David de Gea to provide this gameâ€™s only goal. Hazard himself admits this has been his best campaign, last year having been blighted by moments where â€œI disappeared in some gamesâ€?. â€œHe is the humble star,â€? said Mourinho. â€œPhysically, mentally, heâ€™s becoming very, very strong and he better understands his role. â€œThe day before the United game I told him: â€˜This game we will never lose. Never.â€™ But we needed to win. He understands clearly that, especially in a moment where the team doesnâ€™t have all its power, when the game becomes strategic, his talent is fundamental for the team. He copes better with the responsibility.â€? With Costa hamstrung and FÃ bregas off colour, he is the player who ensures this side is something out of the ordinary. Chelsea could hope to blunt United, working as feverishly as ever all over the pitch to ensure their unbeaten home record was maintained, but it required a spark from the Belgian to leave them victorious. His intervention here, with an 18th goal of the season before the woodwork denied him further reward after the break, has taken Chelsea to the brink of their first league title in five years. Win at the Emirates Stadium next Sunday and the championship can be secured against Leicester City the following Wednesday. The mood at the final whistle on Saturday, while a much-improved United team licked their wounds, was one of joyous celebration, for all that the manager immediately reminded everyone the job is not yet done. â€œWe want it done as soon as possible but if itâ€™s in the last game, so be it,â€? added Mourinho. â€œWe donâ€™t go to Arsenal or to Leicester with the obsession of it has to be today.â€? Regardless, confirmation is close. This has been Chelseaâ€™s title for some time. Man of the match Eden Hazard (Chelsea).
Title:Football transfer rumours: Memphis Depay to Manchester United?
Date:2015-04-20
Content:With 20 goals to his name this season, Memphis Depay is the leading scorer in the Eredivisie. Of course, in a league where cynics consider goals a lot easier to come by compared to elsewhere, that might not seem like a lot â€“ Afonso Alves famously got 34 in 2006-07 and look what happened to him when he moved to pastures new and a mite more competitive. But considering heâ€™s a winger - and a very good one as anybody who watched last summerâ€™s World Cup will know - Depay will almost certainly be delighted with his return of 20 goals in the current campaign, not least because they helped his team PSV Eindhoven secure the Dutch league title at the expense of Ajax over the weekend. During the course of their celebrations, PSV revealed that Manchester United have made concrete enquiries about signing one of Europeâ€™s most exciting prospects, with whom Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur have also been linked. â€œWe have had a telephone call from them about him but no talks have been held yet,â€? said PSV technical director Marcel Brands in a TV interview. â€œThere are several top clubs who have expressed an interest.â€? With PSV resigned to losing Depay and his fellow midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum this summer, it remains only for them to decide on a fee for the duo. Tottenham are rumoured to have bid Â£14.5m for Depay, 21, but Brands insists he will cost whatever club eventually buys him a hell of a lot more. â€œIt will be much higher than the offer from Tottenham Hotspur,â€? said Brands. â€œHe will be very expensive.â€? Reports elsewhere suggest the fee could be closer to Â£25m. Elsewhere in Holland, Feyenoord have joined Marseille and Celtic on the list of former European super-powers that are interested in signing Manchester Cityâ€™s Swedish striker John Guidetti, whose contract expires this summer. Like a child torn between divorcing parents, Espanyol central defender Hector Moreno will be forced to choose between hanging his hat with Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal this summer. The word in Spain is that he has his heart set on pitching up at the Emirates with a teddy bear under his arm in a move that would see Â£15m going into the coffers of the Catalonian club. Martin Skrtel could attempt to get over the crushing disappointment of Liverpoolâ€™s surprise narrative-busting FA Cup semi-final defeat at the hands of Aston Villa by moving to Wolfsburg. With just one year left on his contract, several clubs fancy their chances of signing the Slovakian central defender on the cheap and the Bundesliga side and Napoli are believed to be among them. With Manchester United unlikely to pursue their interest in making Radamel Falcaoâ€™s loan from Monaco permanent, itâ€™s being reported that the Colombianâ€™s agent has tried to rustle up some interest in the out-of-sorts 29-year-old from Liverpool. One player who is attracting interest at Manchester United is Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has made 27 appearances since October, after returning from the back injury that forced him to the sidelines for the entirety of last season. Aaron Lennonâ€™s loan move from Tottenham to Everton will be made permanent if the Merseyside club agree to send Kevin Mirallas and an as yet unspecified number of Â£20 notes the other way. Elsewhere in London, West Hamâ€™s 25-year-old full-back Aaron Cresswell has got antennae twitching at Chelsea and could switch clubs in a deal worth Â£20m to the Hammers. Southampton are believed to be interested in rescuing goalkeeper Tim Krul and defender Daryl Janmaat from their Newcastle purgatory this summer, while Louis van Gaal could send Manchester Unitedâ€™s teenage striker James Wilson to St Jamesâ€™s Park on loan in order to give him some experience of playing in the Premier League. And finally, Stoke City striker Peter Crouch is wanted by Real Madrid and Manchester City, while his goalkeeping team-mate Asmir Begovic is a target for A-League side Newcastle Jets. Actually, hold on ... thatâ€™s not right - Stoke City striker Peter Crouch is wanted by A-League side Newcastle Jets, while his goalkeeping team-mate Asmir Begovic is a target for Real Madrid and Manchester City.
Title:Arsenalâ€™s ArsÃ¨ne Wenger finds time to console stricken Adam Federici
Date:2015-04-19
Content:ArsÃ¨ne Wenger has absolutely been there. The man who has the chance to etch a new record for winning FA Cups on 30 May empathised with the fate that befell Steve Clarke and his team, and in particular Adam Federici, the goalkeeper who will not easily find consolation in the tumbling words about how great he has been over a spell spanning more than 200 games for Reading. â€œSome carry that their whole life,â€? admitted Wenger about the trauma a decisive big-game error can inflict. In the bowels of Wembley, Wenger recalled the horror show his club experienced at the same venue in 2011. Against Birmingham City, in the final minute of a League Cup final heading into extra time, Laurent Koscielny and Wojciech Szczesny lurched into one another to collectively botch an attempted clearance, and the loose ball fell to Obafemi Martins to tap into an empty net. Calamitous. Related: Arsenal supporters enjoy familiar ride as Alexis SÃ¡nchez sets Reading right | David Hytner So, as a manager, how do you deal with such a situation? What can you say to someone who feels responsible? â€œYou can minor a bit the scale of the incident and tell him that it was not only him,â€? offered Wenger. â€œOverall the guy carries that with him. Time helps better than any manager. Once it is done itâ€™s done. You have to live with that. We are not equal in front of that. Some carry that their whole life and some recover quickly and forget about it. [Federici] should be comforted about the fact he had a great game.â€? Without wishing to over-analyse, it was interesting, in the light of that, to examine the stature of both Koscielny and Szczesny as Arsenal plugged away to eventually see off a gutsy Reading in this semi-final. The French defender has become one of Arsenalâ€™s most dependable players, with excellent powers of recovery (and once Per Mertesacker was replaced by the mobile Gabriel Paulista there was an insight into how the defence might evolve next season). Szczesny was jittery. His game, since being shunted to the role of cup keeper by David Ospina, does not currently inspire confidence. Federici and the rest of the Reading squad had a day off on Sunday, and Clarke will have a chat with his goalkeeper on Monday, to reinforce the full support of the club before their return to the Championship on Wednesday against Birmingham. He will be encouraged to get straight back on the goalkeeping horse. â€œHeâ€™ll be fine,â€? said Clarke. â€œHe was very, very disappointed. He just wanted to get inside as quickly as he could and have his sad moment by himself. You have to respect that. â€œHe understands the life of a goalkeeper. When you make the big mistake everyone sees it. Heâ€™s a strong character and on Wednesday night he will be one of our best players again, as usual.â€? Readingâ€™s focus at the end of the Cup campaign is to finish the season as positively as possible and get rebuilding to tackle the Championship with more conviction next term. Clarke pondered the impact of the last couple of seasons for the club â€“ relegation from the Premier League followed by narrow failure to make the play-offs. â€œI think this season is a hangover from those two disappointing years,â€? he said. â€œSo we have to exorcise the place a little bit. We have to clean a little bit, reshape the club. Itâ€™s my job to ensure that we are competitive at the top end of the Championship next year. Thatâ€™s where we have to be.â€? Arsenal were relieved to engineer their way back to Wembley to defend the silverware they won last May. Wenger acknowledged he had gambled in some of the changes to his team selection. Szczesnyâ€™s form remains a concern, and Danny Welbeck lacked the game-knitting stature and all-round power that Olivier Giroud in his current mood brings. Changing both full-backs was also a risk. â€œHÃ©ctor BellerÃ­n has played recently with some ankle problems. Debuchy was back so I thought it was a good moment to do it. It was risky because Debuchy had cramps just before the end of the game but I couldnâ€™t change him,â€? mused Wenger. But even if Arsenal were not at their most fluent, they possessed the attitude and had enough efforts on goal to win through. After all, that is the only true imperative of a semi-final or final. The Reading game was reminiscent of last seasonâ€™s matches against Wigan and Hull in that Arsenal found it a struggle but ultimately won the day. Alexis SÃ¡nchezâ€™s desire to make things happen has been such a hallmark of their season. Returning to that nightmare against Birmingham, this Arsenal team has a more resilient feel about it come the crunch Wembley experiences. â€œWe have learned from our hiccups, we have matured a little bit. Today when we had difficult moments the team kept going. We donâ€™t feel sorry for ourselves. The team has great spirit and togetherness and that helps,â€? insisted Wenger. Within that atmosphere, the internal battle for places in the team for the FA Cup final is hotting up. Wenger smiled to himself: â€œThe final is better than any doctor.â€?

Title:Barcelona wobble on their way up the Tourmalet but emerge unscathed at top | Sid Lowe
Date:2015-04-20
Content:Luis Enrique said he wanted the Camp Nou to tremble and tremble it did, just not the way he hoped. Saturday started with Luis SuÃ¡rez scoring at the south end in the 55th second and ended with Leo Messi scoring at the north end in the last second. In the 92 minutes and four seconds between those goals, they suffered. Eventually El Mundo Deportivo cheered â€œa happy endingâ€? and, surveying the final scene, there was something a bit cinema about it: an explosion, the hero lying on the ground motionless, slowly opening his eyes, looking around, and realising that somehow, with implausible inevitability, heâ€™s still here. Heâ€™s survived; theyâ€™ve actually done it. Now here come his friends, running towards him, relieved and elated, hauling his exhausted body off the floor and embracing him. Or something like that. â€œYouâ€™ll buy the papers tomorrow and read that Barcelona beat us 2-0 but that doesnâ€™t mean anything,â€? the Valencia midfielder AndrÃ© Gomes said. A crowd of 92,915 people came to the Camp Nou; their fear only evaporated with the final kick. Those who arrived too late to see the first goal and left too early to see the second â€“ and although there were fewer than normal, there were plenty of them â€“ had watched through their fingers until, with Valencia pushing for an equaliser, the entire team on the edge of the BarÃ§a area, a long ball clipped into space sent Messi away all alone on one last run. The clock ticked up towards 93 minutes as Messi ran. He missed his chance but got another one, the ball bouncing off Diego Alves and back to his feet, with an open goal before him. There was a huge roar and as Messi celebrated his legs gave way. He lay behind the net, barely moving, arms on his chest, breathing heavily, but when they lifted him up, Dani Alves shaking the cramp from his legs, there was a smile on his face. Barcelona had struggled and they had clung on, desperately waiting for the whistle, but they had survived. More than survived, they had taken a huge step towards the league title, they said. Not least because they had suffered. A total of 56 seconds had been enough at each end of the game, Santi GimÃ©nez describing it in AS as a â€œpalindromic victoryâ€?, one in which bookended by those goals was a match in which â€œBarcelona were crapping themselves so much they needed a prescription for an astringentâ€?. In that time, Valencia had taken 11 shots. As the first half progressed, each chance was clearer than the last. The ball flew across the face of goal, players sliding in, inches away. Shots were sliced wide. And final passes were scuffed. Paco AlcÃ¡cer hit the post and Dani Parejo missed a penalty. Catalansâ€™ cheeks were permanently puffed out. â€œWe suffered,â€? admitted Barcelonaâ€™s goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. â€œNever in my life have I seen a game with so many chances against Barcelona,â€? said his Valencia counterpart Diego Alves. To win you have to know how to suffer Barcelona's Jeremy Mathieu It is hard to recall a game in which Barcelona were dominated so much, in the first half at least. â€œValencia play, BarÃ§a win,â€? said the headline in El PaÃ­s. The Barcelona-supporting columnist Juan Cruz hailed the clubâ€™s new signing: some guy called Miracle. It was a â€œgoing over,â€? said Josep Maria Bartomeu, the president. Thatâ€™s Josep Maria Bartomeu, the Barcelona president. Others used words such as beating, drubbing and bath. â€œThey were better than us,â€? Sergio Busquets agreed. The first half had been â€œsuperb,â€? said Valenciaâ€™s manager, Nuno Espirito Santo. It was also a faithful reflection of their approach for most of the season, the philosophy favoured by Nuno and his Scottish coach Ian Cathro, just even more so. Nuno talked about a â€œsuperhuman effortâ€? and Valencia ran further and faster than Barcelona. And although by the end their energy sapped, they were slowing down, the speed and intensity and the way it was coordinated had mostly been too much for Barcelona, who could not escape the pressure. With Javier Mascherano as the deep midfielder and Busquets and Xavi HernÃ¡ndez in front of him to either side, Valencia suffocated them. Instead of waiting, packing the defence and creating a deep, narrow block to make it hard to find a way through as others have done, Valencia played high, right on top of the Barcelona back four. Right on top of Mascherano and Xavi too, giving them no way out. â€œThe percentage of mistakes we made was abnormally high,â€? Luis Enrique admitted. Only once did Barcelona properly break through the line of pressure, when Busquets found Messi to make the opening goal in the first minute. Instead, Valencia were winning possession a long way up the pitch and heading straight to goal. Barcelona lost the ball constantly and the consequence was usually a player running at them, with others sprinting towards them too. Feghouli in particular terrified Adriano while every pass looked to progress, maintaining momentum and pace. Nothing backwards or sideways, always forward. And forward they came, again and again. The plan worked to perfection, but for one thing: somehow the goal never came. â€œBrave, but no reward,â€? lamented Super Deporte. In the dressing room, the laments were louder. This was the ultimate in frustration for a coach: a game in which it all works, but it doesnâ€™t. For the first time in 10 games, Valencia were beaten and, with AtlÃ©tico Madrid winning, they slipped four points off third place. â€œMy emotions are weird ones,â€? Nuno admitted. â€œI am proud but not satisfied. The first half was brilliant. There were too many chances for the result to end up the way it has. We are convinced that this is the right path to follow and I am proud but not satisfied, because ultimately what matters is the result. We leave here hurt and sad.â€? Barcelona fans came full of enthusiasm but soon became anxious as Valencia dominated. Photograph: Miquel Llop/NurPhoto/Corbis Luis Enrique was delighted. Had this result left Barcelona reforzado, reinforced, he was asked? â€œReforzadÃ­simoâ€?, he replied, adding the superlative. Others followed suit, as if surviving Valencia was better than just beating them. Which, emotionally, it may well be. Titles are made of this, they said. Style matters, but right now scores matter more. â€œTo win you have to know how to suffer,â€? Jeremy Mathieu had said after the win in Vigo; now his words were recovered. â€œWe struggled but got the win,â€? Bravo said. There were other reasons to be happy. SuÃ¡rez scored again. No one got injured. Luis Enrique admitted that there were players who had reached Saturday low on fuel, but they had come through. â€œI am knackered from all the travelling and I havenâ€™t played a single minute,â€? he had said before the game. There is a personality and resilience about Barcelona that was not there before: look at this game and the Vigo game and it is hard to imagine them winning them last season. Then thereâ€™s the fact that Luis Enrique read the game right. At half-time, he took of Adriano, moved Mathieu to left back, put Mascherano at centre-back, put Busquets back in deep midfield and brought on Ivan Rakitic. If they still suffered, if there was no security until the last minute, it was different now. Above all, this was a huge victory because of who it was against and when, because the consequences of defeat or a draw would have been dire and because a draw was always a possibility. Valencia are arguably the strongest side Barcelona will face between now and the end of the season, certainly until they play AtlÃ©tico on the penultimate weekend. After drawing at Sevilla last weekend, when they played significantly better than they did here, they could not drop points again. They have emerged with that reduced two-point lead maintained, with a game fewer to play. â€œThe title, ever closerâ€? ran the cover of Sport; â€œWeâ€™ll win it,â€? ran El Mundo Deportivo, echoing Gerard PiquÃ©â€™s promise after his mistake cost them two points last weekend. The context matters too: the game against PSG and Sevilla, even Celta before that. Much has been made of the fact that a week that could have damaged Barcelonaâ€™s season, called the Tourmalet after the hardest climb on the Tour de Franceâ€™s mountain stages, is now behind them and they are still top. With each passing week, the games played column is almost as important as points won column. On one level that is a curious argument, because they did drop points in Seville last week and they still have the derby at Espanyol to come next week before they set off downhill; they are not through this stage yet and they will not come through it with all the points they wanted. But there is something in it: not least because Real Madrid are about to go into the same run that Barcelona have just come out of: Vigo, Sevilla, Valencia. And there is comfort in the suffering against those teams because if they suffered against them Madrid may suffer against them too. Luis Enrique certainly always knew how significant this was. â€œI donâ€™t normally do this, but this time I am asking them to come because of how big a match this is,â€? the Barcelona manager said. â€œI want the Camp Nou to tremble.â€? For 92 minutes and six seconds, it did just that. Talking points Luka Modric may miss six weeks after picking up an injury against MÃ¡laga. Photograph: Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images â€¢ Real Madrid beat a hugely impressive MÃ¡laga side 3-1 but at a price. Cristiano Ronaldo thumped a penalty against the post, his first miss in 10 this season, but got the third in the last minute and produced an outrageous piece of skill in the first half of a difficult game. Madrid were struggling until James RodrÃ­guez played two one-twos and hit the top corner. The win was a relief and probably an important one but most of the focus was on the bad news. Gareth Bale and Luka Modric picked up injuries and miss the Champions League semi-final second leg with AtlÃ©tico. Bale will be out for two or three weeks, Modric for close to six weeks. Karim Benzema might miss the game too and Marcelo is suspended. FÃ¡bio CoentrÃ£o, his replacement, hasnâ€™t played for over a month. â€¢ â€œMy team behaved very well for the way they were treated,â€? said MÃ¡lagaâ€™s manager Javi Gracia, enigmatically. â€¢ Griezmann. Golazo! He scored two, the first a beauty, to take his total to the season to 20 in the league. â€¢ Speaking of lovely goals â€¦ â€¢ Another late goal, another comeback, another vital point. Not Barral this time â€“ although he did smash one off the bar â€“ but VÃ­ctor CasadesÃºs. He scored in the 87th to give Levante a 2-2 draw with Espanyol and keep them a point ahead of the relegation zone. â€¢ JosÃ© Antonio Romero was wearing a green tie. â€œMy shirt is white but my tie is not black,â€? CÃ³rdobaâ€™s third manager of the season said after his sideâ€™s 0-0 draw with Villarreal. â€œI will not let people bury us while we are still alive.â€? Their chances of survival are few, though. At one point during a game in which they were overrun but escaped without losing, the radio commentator said â€œthe best thing that CÃ³rdoba can do is burst the ballâ€? and the point doesnâ€™t really help much. Theyâ€™re eight points off safety with six games to go. And frankly theyâ€™re not likely to win many of them. They face Athletic, Barcelona, and Rayo. That said, games with Eibar, Granada and Levante do at least give them the chance to close the gap on other sides fighting relegation. â€¢ AlmerÃ­a. This is going to get messy, isnâ€™t it?

The Holland international striker was on the bench for the Premier League defeat against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but played 62 minutes for the under-21s. Adnan Januzaj, 20, and Rafael da Silva, 24, sustained injuries in the game. Januzaj pulled up chasing a ball in the 54th minute, while Da Silva was substituted at the end of the first half after a blow to the ribs. The centre-half Jonny Evans played the full 90 minutes after his return from suspension following the spitting incident involving Newcastleâ€™s Papiss CissÃ©, and nearly scored with a header, saved by Leicesterâ€™s Adam Smith. Van Persie, 31, set up Sean Goss for Unitedâ€™s 32nd-minute equaliser after Harry Panayiotou had volleyed in Leicesterâ€™s opening goal in the 18th minute.
Title:Wolfsburgâ€™s Kevin De Bruyne still open to Manchester City move, says agent
Date:2015-04-21
Content:Kevin De Bruyneâ€™s agent has insisted the Belgium midfielderâ€™s future remains undecided despite reports that he is set to join Bayern Munich for around Â£45m, with Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City among the clubs still interested in signing him from Wolfsburg. De Bruyne, who moved to Germany from Chelsea for Â£18m in January 2014, has enjoyed a superb season, guiding Wolfsburg to second place in the Bundesliga and the quarter-finals of the Europa League. The 23-year-old has racked up 15 goals and an astonishing 22 assists so far and could be in contention to win Germanyâ€™s player of the year award. Related: Manchester United in pole position to sign Memphis Depay from PSV After he masterminded the 4-1 thrashing of Pep Guardiolaâ€™s side at the end of January, Bayern are considered favourites to sign De Bruyne in the summer. However his agent Patrick De Koster says it is too early for any decision to be made. â€œFor the moment, there are no formal discussions. Of course in the next few weeks I will be going around the world to talk about the situation with Kevin but this is just informal information,â€? he said. â€œI will talk to everybody but Kevin is very, very happy with Wolfsburg and the way they have treated him since he arrived from Chelsea last year. There are still five games to play and hopefully they can make sure of a place in the Champions League next season so it is a little bit too early to be making any decisions. He has a four-year contract at Wolfsburg so we will have to see what they want to do.â€? After their struggle to retain their Premier League title with an aging squad this season, De Bruyne fits the profile wanted by City in their drive to lower the age of the squad. De Koster admitted that he has held discussions with Txiki Begiristain, Cityâ€™s director of football, but denied any contact with Manchester United. â€œI have met the people from Manchester City and we know each other,â€? he said. â€œIâ€™ve never spoken to anyone from Manchester United but a lot of other clubs have been in touch to find out some general information. â€œI think with the season Kevin has had if we didnâ€™t have these questions then there would be something wrong. I saw [Mino] Raiolaâ€™s quotes about taking 20 phone calls a day regarding Paul Pogba and itâ€™s the same situation for me and probably for the agent of Memphis Depay at the moment.â€? Asked how much it may cost to prise De Bruyne away from Wolfsburg, De Koster added: â€œI donâ€™t know. Wolfsburg paid â‚¬24m to Chelsea so I can see it being a lot more than that.â€?
Title:Stefan Effenberg: Bayern Munich canâ€™t give Pep Guardiola too much power
Date:2015-04-21
Content:The former Bayern Munich midfielder Stefan Effenberg has warned the club that allowing coach Pep Guardiola to have too much power could be dangerous for their future. Guardiola goes into Tuesday nightâ€™s Champions League quarter-final second leg against Porto under pressure having lost the first leg 3-1 in Portugal. The Spaniard has also been criticised after the resignation of Bayernâ€™s club doctor Hans-Wilhelm MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt and his medical staff following a row, with Guardiola forced to deny speculation that he may not see out the third year of his contract in Germany. But Effenberg, who now works as a TV pundit in Germany after a glittering but often controversial career in which he won three Bundesliga titles and the European Cup with Bayern but also amass 109 yellow cards, believes that the former Barcelona coach must not be allowed to dominate the club. â€œNow you have to watch out so that Guardiola doesnâ€™t get too much power and also decides who is going to make up the new medical staff. That could be dangerous for the future of Bayern,â€? Effenberg told Bild. MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt claimed that his medical department had been chiefly blamed for the defeat against Porto, adding that â€œthe relationship of trust has been permanently damagedâ€?. Guardiola has since denied that was the case but Effenberg believes the doctorâ€™s departure â€œcould have a negative effect on the upcoming games in the next days and weeks.â€? â€œIt must have been pretty serious things in order for MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt to stop working [for Bayern]. Someone like him doesnâ€™t give up easily,â€? he said.
Title:Dark clouds gather over Russiaâ€™s 2018 World Cup preparations
Date:2015-04-21
Content:With just over three years to go until Russia hosts the World Cup, western sanctions and the weakened rouble are taking their toll on preparations, as the government tries to cut costs and avoid the kind of overspend that led to Sochi 2014 becoming the most expensive Olympic Games in history. The Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, said he had spoken with Vladimir Putin during a visit to Russia earlier this year and was assured â€œthere is no intention to ask Fifa to change anything in the pattern and the program of the World Cup and we trust Russia will find a solution.â€? This week the Swiss added that he â€œis a happy and proud president. I am proud that Russia is getting ready to host the World Cup.â€? However, even with the rouble winning back some of its losses since the new year, it is clear that the weaker Russian currency means there will have to be some cutbacks. In January, the sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said administration costs would be cut by 10%, while more recently he announced 25 luxury hotels meant for the â€œFifa familyâ€? would not be built at all. The total budget now stands at 637.6 billion roubles (Â£7.9bn), 4% lower than it was projected to be last year. Earlier this month, the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, signed an order calling for five of the World Cup stadiums currently under construction to provide for the â€œreplacement of equipment and materials of foreign production with Russian analoguesâ€? wherever possible. The order applies to the stadiums in Samara, Saransk, Volgograd, Nizhny Novgorod and Rostov-on-Don, each of which will seat 45,000. The tournament will lead to 12 stadiums being built or reconstructed, two of them in Moscow and the rest spread across the European part of Russia, from Kaliningrad on the Baltic to Yekaterinburg in the Urals. Many supporters will need to utilise air travel, with some host cities 24 hours away from Moscow by train. High-speed links promised for some of the host cities in time for the tournament are unlikely to be ready on time. Even if all the stadiums are constructed on time, there is a fear of white elephants in some of the host cities. Saransk, a surprising inclusion in Russiaâ€™s list, has a population of just 300,000 and normally has only one flight to Moscow a day. Even after its stadium is reduced to a 25,000 capacity after the World Cup, it is unclear whether there will be demand to use it. On 4 April a World Cup organising committee led by the first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, visited Volgograd to check on the preparations. The stadium will be located at the foot of the staggeringly large monument to Mother Russia in the city, which commemorates those who died in the Battle of Stalingrad. However, only a few days after the trip, the local team Rotor Volgograd, expected to play in the stadium when the World Cup is over and who famously beat Manchester United in 1995, announced they had gone bankrupt and were being wound up. There have been some isolated calls to strip Russia of the tournament altogether for its actions in Ukraine, both from Kiev and from the US, where 13 senators, including John McCain, wrote to Fifa to ask them to transfer the event to another country. Russia has already faced problems integrating the football teams in annexed Crimea into the Russian league, while one of the World Cup host cities, Rostov-on-Don, has acted as the staging point for Russiaâ€™s covert invasion of Ukraine, with armour and men crossing the border under cover of night as well as training camps for separatist fighters in the region. The letter signed by the US senators said holding the event in Russia â€œinappropriately bolsters the prestigeâ€? of Putinâ€™s regime at a time when it should be condemned. They pointed out that nearly half of the nations who took part in the 2014 World Cup currently have sanctions on Russia. Such arguments are unlikely to have much sway with Blatter and Fifa, who are not fans of allowing politics to get in the way of football tournaments and the vast revenues they generate. â€œIn my opinion the World Cup in Russia will be able to stabilise all the situation in this region of Europe that is suffering now,â€? said Blatter in response for calls to move the tournament because of the Ukraine issue. â€œI am sure that football is stronger than any other movement.â€?
Title:Bayern Munich 6-1 Porto (7-4 on agg) | Champions League quarter-final second leg match report
Date:2015-04-21
Content:As you were, then, Pep. This was an extraordinary Champions League quarter-final second leg at the Allianz Arena. Chiefly, of course, for Bayern Munichâ€™s magisterial passage into the semi-finals, Pep Guardiolaâ€™s team turning around a 3-1 first-leg deficit to go to half-time 5-0 up, having reduced Porto to a collection of bewildered, ill-fitting parts. Almost as remarkable, in a perverse kind of way, was Portoâ€™s own first-half collapse. They were abject in losing 6-1, undone by Bayernâ€™s ruthless exposing of weakness on the flanks via classically Guardiola-ish switches of play and a bravura performance of centre-forward craft and strength from Robert Lewandowski. â€œWe were very bad in the first half,â€? Portoâ€™s manager, Julen Lopetegui, said. He was wrong though. Porto were not quite as good as that. Otherwise on a balmy, boisterous, slightly dreamy evening in Munich, this was perhaps a night to restore a little burnish to the fondly cherished cult of Pep. These have been interesting times for Guardiola. The exit of a long-serving club doctor, combined with a shabby performance in the first leg of this tie had combined to create, if not doubt, then a tremor of something close. In the event, Bayernâ€™s manager could be seen with his team 5-0 up in the second half still thrashing about on the touchline, at one stage dragging Thomas MÃ¼ller off the pitch to impart some more precise piece of instruction. Somewhere in the mix Guardiola even ripped his trousers open, continuing to point and shout with seams flapping in the wind, gripped with that old familiar crazed conviction. â€œWe can still play better,â€? he insisted. â€œWe lost the ball here and there. We can improve on that. In the Champions League you cannot relax.â€? Pep Guardiolaâ€™s trousers ripped open during Bayern Munichâ€™s 6-1 quarter-final victory over Porto. Photograph: Matthias Schrader/AP Before the kick-off there was the usual rolling roar around this steeply banked plastic oval. MÃ¼ller had urged caution. Fat chance. Deprived of craft on the wings in the absence of Arjen Robben, Franck RibÃ©ry and David Alaba, Guardiolaâ€™s team still managed to overrun Porto on the flanks with almost embarrassing ease in a first half that quickly became a rout. With 10 minutes gone the first clear chance arrived, Lewandowksi hitting the post after MÃ¼llerâ€™s shot had been palmed across goal by Fabiano. Lopetegui erupted into a capering dance of fury on the touchline, rightly incredulous that his team could be cut open so easily. Porto were hindered by the absence of the regular full-backs Danilo and Sandro. Fatally so as Bayern, like any good Guardiola team, ganged up on a weak spot to brilliant effect. With 14 minutes gone the first goal arrived. Juan Bernat showed lovely control to skip past Diego Reyes on the left. His cross was perfectly measured for Thiago AlcÃ¢ntara to drift in front of the defence and head in from five yards. It was a beautifully simple goal, well-executed and well-planned. Guardiola is said to give three separate pre-match team talks. Presumably â€œknock it in behind the full-backs every timeâ€? was in each one. With 22 minutes gone Bayern squared the aggregate score with another headed goal. Philipp Lahmâ€™s corner from the right was headed back across by Holger Badstuber and JÃ©rÃ´me Boateng rose highest to nod past Fabiano. The Allianz Arena was in a state of perpetual triumphant uproar by now and within five minutes Bayern had pretty much killed the tie as Lewandowski scored a beautiful third to make it 4-3 on aggregate. Lahm crossed from near the corner flag. MÃ¼llerâ€™s touch to redirect the path of the ball with his instep was sublime, gangling perfection and Lewandowski headed past Fabiano. It was a wonderful moment of craft, a goal without any particular qualities of pace or trickery, made instead by high-class touches in space. Bayernâ€™s Thomas MÃ¼ller celebrates with fans after the game. Photograph: Matthias Schrader/AP With half an hour gone the right-back Reyes was removed from the field by Lopetegui and replaced by Ricardo. Too little too late, though, as the fourth goal arrived on 36 minutes. MÃ¼ller scored it, taking a shot from 30 yards that was deflected off Martins Indi and spun in horrible slow motion past the flailing Fabiano. Four was humiliation enough but somehow the fifth was always coming. This time Lahm crossed from the right, Lewandowski took the ball under little pressure, switched feet to make space and shot low and hard into the corner. And so Bayern left the field at the break having turned a 3-1 deficit into a 6-3 lead. Porto had collapsed, first on the flanks and then through the spine of the team, the defence unable to cope with Lewandowskiâ€™s movement and razor-edged finishing. Porto did pull a goal back with 73 minutes gone, Jackson MartÃ­nez heading in from close range. After which they even had some chances to make Bayern sweat over the aggregate score before IvÃ¡n Marcano received a straight red on 87 minutes for hacking down Thiago. Xabi Alonso popped the free-kick over the wall and into the corner to cap a night of frictionless red-shirted destruction.
Title:The Fiver | Donations from the public to poor Real Madrid
Date:2015-04-22
Content:ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER MADRID DERBY Bang! Clank! Ouch! Oh, hi there, reader, you join us just as The Fiver is in its workshop/office/bedroom/toilet/pavement trying to knock up a placard calling for donations from the public to poor Real Madrid, who find themselves in a state of near destitution as they prepare to contest tonightâ€™s second leg of their Big Cup quarter-final against city rivals AtlÃ©tico, with the tie fiendlishly poised at 0-0. Real have already faced their bullying neighbours seven times this season and failed to win even once, and tonight they must cope without Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric, who are all knacked, Marcelo, who is suspended, and Alan Pardew, whom they have not yet got around to appointing. Itâ€™s all very well divvying up practically all of La Ligaâ€™s TV revenue with their business partners in Catalonia, but having to go through the formality of actually beating other teams on the pitch, too, is proving very wearisome for Real. So come on, reader, give generously! Bang! Clank! Ouch! No, reader, weâ€™re not still making that placard, because weâ€™ve just realised that weâ€™ve run out of wood and donâ€™t know where to find any more. Thatâ€™s right, reader, The Fiver canâ€™t get wood, no need to labour the point. Bang! Clank! Ouch! That then, reader, is the likely soundtrack to tonightâ€™s clash at the BernabÃ©u, as AtlÃ©tico get stuck into their neighbours and Real grow frustrated at their inability to penetrate and the tussle degenerates into pushing and shoving and rolling and biting and kicking and mewling and puking [basically the good stuff â€“ Fiver Ed]. â€œWe want to savour and enjoy more nights like these because they donâ€™t come around often,â€? blared Diego Simeone before that eighth meeting with Real this season. The Rojiblancos have problems too, much more serious ones than the fact that most English speakers have no idea who the Rojiblancos are, which is why hipsters should cease using the term forthwith. Firstly, Mario SuÃ¡rez is suspended. Secondly, Mario Mandzukic may not be fit enough to resume his entertaining strop with Dani Carvajal and Sergio Ramos. But Simeone is putting on a brave face. â€œWe have players who can keep us safe at the back,â€? he said, before adding almost as an afterthrought: â€œAnd attack, if possible.â€?

Title:Football transfer rumours: Branislav Ivanovic to Bayern Munich or PSG?
Date:2015-04-23
Content:Zinedine Zidane has been carrying on like a four-year-old again. He has announced that he likes Eden Hazard, a development that has been interpreted as bad news for Chelsea. For many people, it means that Real Madrid will be signing the Belgian wizard this summer. But what if this is a case of two plus two equalling SUMMER TRANSFER SAGA? What went unreported is that Zidane went on to say that he is also very much enjoying the new series of Mad Men and no one is writing that Madrid have identified Matthew Weiner as the man to lead their line next season. By the way, just so you all know, the Mill has been announcing that it likes Hazard every day and no one has batted an eyelid. No one has even checked to see if the Mill secretly has hundreds of millions stashed away, ready to splurge it all on Hazard. Obviously thereâ€™s no money, but thatâ€™s not the point. The point is no one listens. Anyway. Chelsea could also be set to lose Branislav Ivanovic, a target for Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain. Not to worry, though, theyâ€™ll replace him with Southamptonâ€™s Nathaniel Clyne. Southampton will cheer themselves up by signing Feyenoordâ€™s Jordy Clasie, but they could be about to lose Victor Wanyama to Arsenal. He reckons that ArsÃ¨ne Wenger is a fan. â€œWenger has been talking about me,â€? Wanyama said. â€œAnd he has let it be known he would like to sign me this summer.â€? The Mill is doing its unconvinced face. Internazionale are going to knock Asmir Begovic out and then place him in a room with news items from 2010 in a bid to make the Stoke goalkeeper think that they are still a big club. Theyâ€™ll make him think thereâ€™s an important election on and then theyâ€™ll entice him with a big contract. Foolproof. Inter also want Manchester Cityâ€™s Yaya TourÃ©. So do PSG. By the way, his birthday is soon. Liverpool are going to dangle Rickie Lambert in front of Crystal Palace, while trying to make off with Yannick Bolasie for Â£10m. They are also sniffing around Romaâ€™s Radja Nainggolan. Swansea are eyeing Blackburnâ€™s Rudy Gestede, Sunderland are flexing their muscles in the direction of Werder Bremenâ€™s Franco Di Santo, THE MILL LIKES EDEN HAZARD.
Title:Hearts in mouths as Bournemouth can almost touch the promised land | Jacob Steinberg
Date:2015-04-23
Content:The nerves were jangling. Heart rates were soaring. Bournemouth, reduced to 10 men, were minutes away from beating Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 and edging closer to the Premier League for the first time in their history. Matt Ritchieâ€™s thunderbolt had threatened to take the roof off the Goldsands Stadium; Bournemouth were heading back to the top of the Championship. There was a sting in the tail, an equaliser for Wednesday in the fifth minute of extra time, and drawing meant that Bournemouth went second. Automatic promotion is still in their hands but the margin for error is almost nonexistent. They are above Middlesbrough thanks to their vastly superior goal difference and will surely be promoted if they win their final two matches â€“ they host Bolton Wanderers on Monday night and visit Charlton Athletic the following Saturday â€“ and the excitement in Bournemouth is matched only by the tension. Maybe this is how it was meant to happen. This is a club who began the 2008-09 season on minus 17 points. Their ground holds 11,700 and their average attendance is 10,500. They have gone close to falling out of the Football League, were straitjacketed by a transfer embargo for more than a year and have stared extinction in the face. Jeff Mostyn, Bournemouthâ€™s chairman, had to inject his own cash to ensure that they did not enter liquidation. â€œFive years ago we were on the abyss,â€? Mostyn says. â€œWe were 10 minutes away from the Conference and the chances are we would never have got out of the Conference with the resources we had available to us at that stage.â€? Their turnaround has been astonishing. Bournemouth owe much of their revival to the backing of their owner, Maxim Demin, the Russian billionaire who took full control of the club in 2013. Mostyn sold his 50% stake to Demin in 2011 and Eddie Mitchell, the former chairman, followed suit two years later. Demin has helped Bournemouth put their days of financial chaos behind them. Then there is Eddie Howe, who was named the Football League manager of the decade last Sunday. Mostyn calls Bournemouthâ€™s manager a demigod. â€œYou couldnâ€™t rate a manager any more highly than Eddie,â€? Mostyn says. â€œHeâ€™s a fantastic leader. He has the ability to inspire, both those who have just joined the football club and those who have been here for a while. Kenwyne Jones, who joined us on loan from Cardiff, said after the first week of training that he is the best club manager he has ever worked with. For someone of Kenwyneâ€™s quality to give that kind of accolade just sums him up.â€? Howe was the youngest manager in the league when he was appointed by Bournemouth in 2008. A former player who was forced into an early retirement, he was 31 and his only job was to keep them in League Two. Howe won promotion to League One in 2010. Now 37, he is in his second spell after he left Burnley for personal reasons in October 2012. Bournemouth were 21st in League One when Howe returned, but he led them to automatic promotion and it was a smooth transition into the Championship. They finished 10th last season. Eddie Howe was named Football League manager of the decade after his magnificent work at Bournemouth. Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Rex Shutterstock/James Marsh/BPI/Rex Shutterstock Mostyn says that Howe is a private person despite the articulate way he presents himself in public and that he is happiest when he is on the training ground. Howe, who first joined the club when he was 10, believes in a passing game and Bournemouthâ€™s football is often a delight to watch. Howe has ensured that Bournemouth have a laudable vision. â€œThe whole raison dâ€™Ãªtre of the club was built around his ethos of playing football on the floor,â€? Mostyn says. â€œThis starts off from the kids and right through to the first team. He knows that anybody can be elevated via the youth squad without having to be retrained. Heâ€™s surrounded himself with people he has confidence in. Most of the coaches have played with Eddie. That can only be good for the future.â€? What stands out about the clubâ€™s success is that their squad is not packed with household names, even though they have a rich Russian owner. Their scouting department is small but their transfers have been brilliantly astute. Harry Arter, for instance, was signed from non-league Woking for Â£4,000 and now he is one of the best midfielders in the Championship. Bournemouth sold their top scorer, Lewis Grabban, to Norwich City for Â£3.5m last summer and signed Coventry Cityâ€™s Callum Wilson as his replacement for Â£2.3m. Wilson, 23, has scored 22 goals. Howe, who is ably assisted by Jason Tindall, improves players. â€œWe watched Callum a lot last season,â€? Steve Fletcher, Bournemouthâ€™s head of recruitment, says. â€œCould we foresee him being as effective as he has been? We hoped and the manager obviously saw a lot of potential in Callum after we lost Lewis. Itâ€™s down to Eddie and the coaching staff, making him into the animal he is today. We knew he had pace and goalscoring ability but his all-round ability has improved massively. â€œThe good thing is that everyone who works for the department cares about the manager â€“ we all have an affiliation with him somewhere along the line, whether weâ€™ve played alongside him or worked under him â€“ and we love the club as well. Weâ€™re all good friends with Eddie. Myself and Richard Hughes played with him and under him. Weâ€™ve got his nephew, Andy Howe, working with us and Des Taylor, whoâ€™s been with Eddie from when he started as a manager.â€? Fletcher, a Bournemouth legend, has been scouting since retiring in 2013 and says that Bournemouth look for players who can easily slot into their style of play. â€œThe manager wants it done thoroughly,â€? Fletcher says. â€œHeâ€™s so meticulous. He wants to know every little thing about every player.â€? Bournemouth have their critics. The presence of Demin dictates that not everyone has been swept away by the romance. The Russian was introduced to the club when he met Mitchell, a builder, who had been contracted to build Demin a house on Sandbanks, the exclusive peninsula near Poole which is home to famously expensive properties and Harry Redknapp. Demin is mainly based in Switzerland and little is known about his background, his business or the source of his wealth. His UK company, Wintel Petrochemicals, is owned by a trust registered in the tax haven of Guernsey. Bournemouth supporters can almost touch the top flight. Photograph: David Fitzgerald/BNPS Mostyn is protective of Demin and irritated by claims that Bournemouth have thrown cash around. There were fears from outside the club that Bournemouth were going to fall foul of financial fair play rules after they posted a loss of Â£15.3m for 2012-13. The maximum permitted loss for a Championship club each year is Â£8m, but Bournemouth passed their FFP test in December. â€œThis club has no debt whatsoever,â€? Mostyn says. â€œWe reported a deficit last year. The reason is there for everybody to see. The ground is the smallest in the Championship. You cannot possibly balance the books with matchday income from only 10,500 people, so the owner has put investment into the club, not loans. You are prohibited from putting loans into a club. â€œWe will still have one of the lowest wage bills in the Championship. We compete but we are always going to be in need of cash injection with the size of the ground and the facilities compared with other Championship clubs that can call upon crowds of 20,000 and 30,000.â€? Bournemouth will not get carried away if they are promoted. They are conscious of the need to expand their ground but they will not make decisions on a whim. They may not go up this season but they are determined to build proper foundations for the future, without forgetting the lessons of the past. â€œI think we always look to make progress,â€? Mostyn says. â€œWe have a fantastic sport scientist, Dan Hodges, we have Garvan Stewart, our head analyst. We have a great medical team here and medical facilities elsewhere. We have come through the ranks slightly ahead of our time and we havenâ€™t had the time to stand still and have a look at what facilities we would need. â€œWe will ensure that the team and Eddie have the facilities that suit the environment weâ€™re playing in. We will not invest in what may not happen and then find you have a catalogue of financial problems when things go pear-shaped in the future. What weâ€™ve said is that any major decisions will probably be based on longevity and we would want to ensure that we could retain our status in the Premier League.â€? Will the fairytale have a happy ending? â€œMost people outside Bournemouth would have expected us to implode by now,â€? Mostyn says. â€œBut weâ€™re like the noisy neighbour. Weâ€™re still knocking on the door and defying the odds.â€?
Title:Nigel Pearson: â€˜I donâ€™t like all I am but youâ€™ve got to live with itâ€™ | Stuart James
Date:2015-04-23
Content:Nigel Pearson has been candidly rowing back over a season that has thrown up more than its fair share of incident, when an analogy involving Peter Snowâ€™s Swingometer and the relegation battle leads the conversation into general election territory and whether the Leicester City manager tunes into the leadersâ€™ debates. â€œNooooo,â€? Pearson says, sounding dismayed. â€œTheyâ€™re all pandering. People whose views are swung when you get into these ridiculous debates â€“ I think theyâ€™re all nonsense. Youâ€™ve got to have a fundamental belief, youâ€™ve got to believe in what you believe in. If you go into something like this thinking: â€˜Hmmm, Iâ€™ll see what they come up with this year ...â€™â€? Other than predicting another coalition government, Pearsonâ€™s own political views are not for public consumption. â€œIâ€™m staunchly something but itâ€™s none of your business,â€? he says with the hint of a smile, before suggesting it would be presumptuous to read too much into the fact that he has already disclosed he buys the Guardian. It turns out that Pearson likes to do the crossword. Leicesterâ€™s Nigel Pearson swears at journalist after Hull draw. He also confesses to enjoying reading the obituaries, which in some peopleâ€™s eyes will probably fit the popular characterisation of Pearson as a rather morose man. By his own admission, the former Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough captain can be â€œvery moodyâ€?. He has no time for â€œcrap questionsâ€? in press conferences and is prone to making a â€œflippant remark from time to timeâ€? to cause a bit of a stir. â€œThereâ€™s a bit of mischief in there,â€? Pearson says. â€œWhether people think there is or not, Iâ€™m not really bothered, to be honest with you.â€? As for the public perception of him, Pearson has a reasonable gauge of the mood. â€œIâ€™ve been quite open in our press conferences and yet the only bits they ever use are the ones that would back up the persona. I get the words â€˜dourâ€™ and â€˜miserableâ€™ quite often. If thatâ€™s what people think, fine. I donâ€™t think I am like that.â€? It is certainly not how Pearson comes across in his office at Leicesterâ€™s training ground and there is no reason to suspect that the 51-year-old has undergone a personality change because three successive wins have lifted Leicester off the bottom of the table for the first time since November. â€œThatâ€™s me at work in the public domain,â€? he says of the footage that colours opinion of him. â€œItâ€™s not me at work here.â€? Gregarious and generous with his time, Pearson does a nice line in self-deprecating humour and, to his credit, fronts up when it comes to his various scrapes this season. â€œJust ask me the questions,â€? he says. â€œI donâ€™t mind because theyâ€™re things Iâ€™ve done and said. You canâ€™t have it both ways. You either like or donâ€™t like people warts and all. Youâ€™ve got to look yourself in the mirror. I donâ€™t like all the aspects of what I do and am, or things Iâ€™ve done, but youâ€™ve got to live with it.â€? The charge sheet, in order, reads: an ugly spat with a Leicester fan; that grapple with Crystal Palaceâ€™s James McArthur â€“ which was followed by Pearsonâ€™s â€œsackingâ€? 24 hours later; a war of words with Gary Lineker and, after the goalless draw with Hull City last month, some colourful language for a journalist. The incident with the Leicester supporter, which came towards the end of the 3-1 home defeat against Liverpool in December, seems the obvious place to start. The Football Association fined Pearson Â£10,000 and gave him a one-match touchline ban for telling a fan who was abusing him to â€œfuck off and dieâ€?. What does Pearson think about it now? â€œI regret offending people in the general area. With the individual I donâ€™t have any regrets at all,â€? he says. â€œI donâ€™t like the fact that Iâ€™m probably better known for that and telling another journalist heâ€™s something else than anything else this season. But that shows you the type of industry it is at times. â€œI wouldnâ€™t try and justify the events [with the fan]. I donâ€™t believe in that. What I did get is quite a bit of support from people within the game and I think what that probably illustrates is a level of frustration regarding what you just spoke about [how a fan can verbally abuse a player or manager without any sanction]. I had people saying: â€˜Weâ€™ve all been thinking it.â€™ I think that shows you that there is this underground feeling of â€¦ I think thereâ€™s empathy, which is an interesting emotion to feel for people under difficult pressures. And I know people will say: â€˜What pressure is a football manager under?â€™ But thatâ€™s the industry I work in and I try and be as conscientious as I can be. But Iâ€™m a human being and Iâ€™ll get things wrong.â€? Nigel Pearson speaks candidly about a season that has been packed with incident but that may end with Leicester staying up. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian Two months later came that rather bizarre altercation with McArthur, when Pearson ended up kneeling over the Palace player with his hands round his throat. â€œMaybe a bit naive on my part but it was all pretty innocuous stuff,â€? he says. â€œBecause I kept a deadpan face thereâ€™s this aggression that gets built into it, but the bottom line is thatâ€™s not how it was. The lad was brilliant with it, to be fair, because he defused it straight away. He sent me a text the next day, I started to do a text back and then thought Iâ€™d just give him a ring.â€? Another storm, however, was brewing at the King Power Stadium. Later that Sunday reports emerged that Pearson had been sacked and at one stage it certainly appeared that the manager and people at the club believed that was the case. â€œThings happen in football â€¦ it was a difficult weekend, letâ€™s put it like that,â€? Pearson says. â€œPotentially that sort of story could have been very damaging. There were social media tweets from people which didnâ€™t go down particularly well. But what we tried to do is just draw a line under that weekend and move on. I donâ€™t think it would be right to say what went on. It was an internal thing. How the story broke and got into the public domain, I still havenâ€™t got a clue. It was all a bit strange.â€? Lineker was among those to have his say on social media and Pearson took exception to the way that the Match of the Day host, along with Danny Murphy and Jermaine Jenas, the two pundits on the show on the Saturday night, dissected the McArthur confrontation and, in the Leicester managerâ€™s eyes, â€œmade a mountain out of a molehillâ€?. At his press conference on the Monday Pearson pointedly said: â€œI pay my tax billsâ€? â€“ which was interpreted as a dig at Lineker in relation to a disputed allegation about the finances of the former Leicester striker, who is also the clubâ€™s honorary vice-president. Pearson is not afraid to speak his mind and rattle a few cages if need be but, with good reason, he has no intention of reigniting a fire that has long gone out. Leicester are buoyant at the moment, the feelgood factor within the club is tangible and the last thing the manager wants to do is risk destabilising everything. â€œIâ€™m trying to concentrate on what weâ€™re trying to do on the pitch,â€? Pearson says, politely. â€œI donâ€™t think there is anything to be gained by myself, or the football club, to reopen that [Lineker row]. For me itâ€™s a closed chapter and thatâ€™s how I see it.â€? Perhaps we will read more about it if Pearson brings out a book one day â€“ something which he hinted could be in the pipeline on the day of the row with Lineker. The book, Pearson said at the time, would have nothing to do with football. â€œI think what Iâ€™ve observed about myself this season is that Iâ€™ve occasionally come out with some real pearlers, which Iâ€™d rather not have come out with,â€? Pearson says laughing as the quote he gave at the time is read back to him. â€œI wonâ€™t write a book. I havenâ€™t got a magnum opus in me. Whoâ€™d fucking buy it for a start?â€? It is safe bet that the journalist whom Pearson called a â€œprickâ€? at the end of his press conference after the Hull game would not be on ghost-writing duties. Annoyed with the reporterâ€™s line of questioning, in particular a reference to whether Leicesterâ€™s season was â€œwaxing or waningâ€?, Pearsonâ€™s withering comments were picked up as he left his seat. â€œIt was unfortunate,â€? he says. â€œI suppose thereâ€™s the mischief side in me, probably subliminally knowing that the microphone is still on. â€œHe [the reporter] was quite clever, because there was something that happened in the Thursday presser, the â€˜waxing and the waningâ€™. I said [when asked about the tide turning]: â€˜I think youâ€™ll find thatâ€™s to do with the gravitational pull of the moonâ€™, thinking â€˜yeah, alrightâ€™, and it got regurgitated after the game. And I suppose thereâ€™s the Liverpool game at home, Palace, so thereâ€™s this cumulative effect of: â€˜Is he losing his marbles? Is the pressure getting to him?â€™ And those type of angles can gather a bit of momentum. What it does is, it makes you reflect on what you do and how you do it, and it would be a shame if I became even more guarded than I am.â€? Pearson admits at times â€œthere is an element of roleplayâ€? to his behaviour but the one thing he will not do is please people for the sake of it. To illustrate his point he talks about how much he enjoyed watching games from the stand and the pressure he came under to be in the technical area. â€œIâ€™m not going to all of a sudden start wearing a snazzy suit and putting a scarf around my neck, which seemed to be vogue for about 20 minutes at one point,â€? Pearson says. â€œIâ€™ll do what I think is best for the players. Some of the players, I think, would probably rather I sit in the stand!â€? Whatever anyone thinks of Pearson, his managerial record stacks up. He won promotion from League One as champions with Leicester in his first spell, claimed the Championship title last season in his second stint in charge and Premier League survival is now within touching distance. With four of their final six games at home and both away fixtures against relegation rivals, Burnley on Saturday and Sunderland in the penultimate game of the season, Leicester are odds on to stay up. Not that Pearson is getting carried away. â€œI can sense when there is a shift, all of a sudden itâ€™s â€˜Leicester will be all right nowâ€™. Bullshit,â€? he says. â€œWeâ€™ve got to be really focused now, try and influence what you can here and not join in with the daily and weekly debates. Itâ€™s almost like Peter Snowâ€™s Swingometer on election night. And how interesting is that? Well, itâ€™s not, is it? The bottom line is that results come in when the votes are counted and yet people put so much emphasis on a swing which may not actually have a huge bearing on it. Ultimately weâ€™ve got to try and do our own job.â€? The same goes for Pearson. â€œI have to accept what I am, rather than necessarily change for the sake of it,â€? he says. â€œThatâ€™s not to say that I donâ€™t believe in finding ways to improve. If I thought this is as far as I can go, I may as well just get in my car, go home and start dead-heading the daffodils.â€?

Title:The Fiver | Lake Geneva pork shoulder and jowl
Date:2015-04-24
Content:RIEDLE ME THIS â€¦ To Nyon, the Swiss municipality that serves as picturesque location of the lakeside HQ of Uefa. This morning, somewhere in the discreet but well appointed main building that is tucked beneath the glass pavilions which serve as a symbol of the organisationâ€™s well documented transparency, Uefa blazer and chief bingo caller Gianni Infantino presided over the semi-final draws for Big Vase and Big Cup, ably aided by his glamorous assistant, former Germany international Karl-Heinz Riedle, who glories in the vague but no doubt lucrative position of Uefa Big Cup ambassador and whose duties include occasionally serving as Debbie McGee to Gianniâ€™s Paul Daniels. Having got the formalities out of the way â€“ Napoli v Dnipro Dniprodniprodniprodniprodnipro and Sevilla v Fiorentina in Big Vase â€“ it was down to the big business of the day: Big Cup semi-final draw â€“ four plastic footballs containing the names of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and Bayern Munich, plus one transparent plastic bowl. With representatives of all four teams present, they were visibly on tenterhooks as they excitedly pondered the various glorious possibilities and permutations that lay in store at the subsequent lunch buffet. With a minimum of fuss that was as welcome as it was surprising, Riedle proceeded to pair Barcelona with Bayern Munich and Juventus with Real Madrid, prompting journalists everywhere to come up with potential narratives: Pep Guardiola taking on the team he led to two Big Cup crowns, Juventus avenging their defeat at the hands of Real Madrid in the 1998 final, the possibility of the first ever Real Madrid v Barcelona final and the millions and millions of pounds the Fiverâ€™s castanet-clacking, guitar-plucking, siesta-taking, bull-fighting Spanish cousin Ole! Ole! Ole! Lispy Bit Dog That Looks Like Chuck Blazer Cinco El Sid Fiver would earn from all the podcast, radio and TV appearances, newspaper and magazine articles heâ€™d get to write before, during and after such a match-up. Then thereâ€™s the book and its subsequent movie rights â€¦ oh, The Fiver knows who its castanet-clacking, guitar-plucking, siesta-taking, bull-fighting Spanish cousin Ole! Ole! Ole! Lispy Bit Dog That Looks Like Chuck Blazer El Sid Fiver is rooting for in both semi-finals. Before adjourning to the canteen for their pre-lunch snack of Lake Geneva pork shoulder and jowl, with parsnips, roast cauliflower puree, buckwheat and juniper with tomato ketchup (vegetarian option: purple sprouting broccoli, goatâ€™s curd, grilled onion, land seaweed and verjus), the representatives of the clubs involved were obliged to sing for their supper and give their thoughts on the draw, with none prepared to put their neck on the block and state outright for the record that they fully expected their team to proceed to the final in Berlin. However, Fiver favourite and Dulux dog lookalike Pavel Nedved came closest to making a Big Call. â€œWe will go and play our own game fairly and do our part, we want to enjoy it,â€? said the former Juve midfielder on his teamâ€™s ding-dong with Real. â€œWe werenâ€™t expecting to be 15 points clear in the league, in the semi-final of [Big Cup] and in the Coppa Italia final. Itâ€™s crazy to talk about the opposition being better. We must play the same way we always have, we have a chance and they will be two fantastic matches.â€? In bad news for Juve, The Fiverâ€™s calling a second consecutive all-Spanish final, in yet another poke in the eye for those who would have us believe a certain other country runs the Best League In The World. QUOTE OF THE DAY â€œI can, 100%, absolutely confirm it was not bird poo. But Iâ€™d love to know who put that video out and how they did it.

Youâ€™re not even a C0ckney!â€™ And he would stand there, staring at me blankly, like I was some kind of crazed, pedantic lunaticâ€? â€“ Marten Allen. â€œSo I clicked on the link for the piece about Theo Walcott being at Arsenal for nine years, from yesterdayâ€™s Fiver, and got a Guardian message saying: â€˜Sorry we havenâ€™t been able to serve what you asked for.â€™ Itâ€™s the first accurate, concise and to-the-point article Iâ€™ve read in the Guardian for a long time.

Title:Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s Southampton return will bring warmth from staff but bile from fans
Date:2015-04-24
Content:The expressions on the faces of the dozen or so diners betrayed surprise and delight. It was an end-of-season meal last May, in honour of a couple of junior members of the Southampton recruitment department who were leaving the club, and nobody expected Mauricio Pochettino to turn up. But there he was. And, at the end of the bash, the manager picked up the bill. Nobody thought he was anything other than a guy with class. The episode is one of many over the course of Pochettinoâ€™s 18-month tenure at Southampton that illustrated the bond he enjoyed with his colleagues, and how he finessed it. Every day, he would pop his head around doors to say hello. His regular attendance at under-13 matches, for example, and the way he would chat to the boysâ€™ parents in that courteous manner of his, is fondly remembered. When he showed up unannounced at the restaurant that night, he was still in charge at Southampton â€“ just about. The stories linking him with a move to Tottenham Hotspur were growing in intensity and, on 27 May, it was confirmed he would be succeeding the sacked Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane. Inside the club at Southampton, there was disappointment but realism. They know that managers no longer stick around like Ted Bates or Lawrie McMenemy. To borrow a phrase from Pochettino: this is football. The friendships that were formed with the Argentinian were not going to fall apart over a career move and, when he returns to St Maryâ€™s for the first time with Tottenham on Saturday, the welcome behind the scenes will be warm. Up in the stands, it will be markedly different. Pochettinoâ€™s defection was not in the same league as that of Harry Redknapp, who took Southampton down from the Premier League in 2005 and then returned to the clubâ€™s hated rivals, Portsmouth. But it is interesting to hear the view of Steve Grant, who runs the fansâ€™ forum SaintsWeb, on the reception Pochettino can expect. â€œIt will not be Redknapp levels but it wonâ€™t be far off,â€? Grant says. â€œA lot of people felt very let down by Pochettino although, given the fact he arrived in an underhand manner, people should not be particularly surprised that he left in an underhand manner. The most recent event, though, takes precedent.â€? Pochettino had been hired by the clubâ€™s former chairman, Nicola Cortese, in January 2013 to replace Nigel Adkins. Southampton were 15th in the Premier League and only two teams had worse defensive records, but they had just come from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Chelsea and Adkins was very popular with the fans. â€œIt wasnâ€™t my fault,â€? Pochettino says. â€œThe president offered me the job. But it was a tough situation.â€? Pochettinoâ€™s reign was fired by the victories over Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea in his first nine games and his status was cemented by the eighth-placed finish last season. He appreciated the values of the club; he was not afraid to give young players their chance and he imbued the team with greater defensive stability and an attractive, high-pressing style, even if his tactics seemed to lack a Plan B. In short, Pochettino took Southampton to the next level and so when he left, it was harder to bear, particularly when he was followed by a clutch of important players. Many supporters suspected that when Pochettino knew he was going, he told Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert that they might see it as a good time to move too, which they did. Once at Tottenham, Saints fans raged when Pochettino tried to sign Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez, although they would be kept at St Maryâ€™s. Mauricio Pochettino was popular at Southampton but the manner of his departure means he will receive a frosty reception from some fans. Photograph: Richard Sellers/Getty Images Southampton were supposed to be destined for a difficult season but it speaks volumes for the structures and methodologies they have in place that they have been able to restrengthen and look even better. In Ronald Koeman, they recruited a stellar managerial name, whose professionalism, tactical nous and personality have shone from the outset while their signings have been excellent. Pochettino makes the point that Koeman has been allowed to spend around Â£70m in fees on reshaping the squad â€“ overlooking the fact that Southampton recouped Â£92.5 from sales last summer â€“ while he has been permitted only Â£32m at Tottenham. â€œItâ€™s a massive difference with us this season,â€? Pochettino says. But Pochettino is a generous type, with barely a bad word for any rival and he is full of praise for Koemanâ€™s work. With Southampton sitting seventh, one point and one place behind Tottenham, he even says that Koeman should win the manager of the year award. One testament to how Southampton have come to function as an organisation is that Tottenham have seemingly tried to copy them. They took Paul Mitchell from Southampton last November to become their head of recruitment and he has restructured their academy and scouting system, attempting to make the processes more holistic, as they are at Southampton. For a long time, Tottenhamâ€™s scouting has been a mess. â€œWe have created a strong structure in the club with [the sporting director] Franco Baldini, Paul Mitchell and a lot of people that have joined us in the department of scouting,â€? Pochettino says. â€œThey are ready to take decisions and try to improve our squad.â€? Pochettino has done a good job so far in what he says must be considered a transitional season but Koeman and Southampton plan an uncomfortable afternoon for him, as they chase Europa League qualification. Sixth place would guarantee it; seventh would be enough if Arsenal won the FA Cup. Pochettino is less keen to experience another Europa League campaign. Last summer, nobody could have foreseen a battle between Southampton and Tottenham â€“ or even fifth-placed Liverpool, who took Lallana, Lambert and Dejan Lovren from St Maryâ€™s. But Saints supporters can dream of having an extremely loud last laugh. â€œIn our 130-year history, Liverpool are the only club we have never finished above,â€? Grant says. â€œWhen we came second in 1984, Liverpool were the champions. To finish above them and Spurs would be perfect.â€?
Title:JosÃ© Mourinho defends â€˜less artisticâ€™ Chelsea against ArsÃ¨ne Wenger jibes
Date:2015-04-24
Content:JosÃ© Mourinho has dismissed ArsÃ¨ne Wengerâ€™s suggestion it is â€œeasy to defendâ€? and moved to justify Chelseaâ€™s switch from an expansive to a more pragmatic style over recent weeks as they home in on a first Premier League title in five years. Mourinho will attempt to establish a 13-point advantage over Arsenal with victory at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, ensuring Chelsea would claim the championship by winning at Leicester on Wednesday. Wenger, whose side have won their past eight league games, has never beaten a Mourinho team in 12 attempts and has struggled to conceal his contempt for the cagey, if undeniably effective, manner in which his rivalâ€™s teams have often played. The Arsenal manager was explaining how his players would be prepared to adapt their approach when he said: â€œItâ€™s easy to defend. If we have to defend, then we will defend.â€? Yet that notion was rejected out of hand by Mourinho. â€œItâ€™s not easy, not easy,â€? he said. â€œIf it was easy you wouldnâ€™t lose 3-1 at home to Monaco [in the Champions League]. If he defends well he draws 0-0 against Monaco and wins in Monte Carlo. Itâ€™s not easy to defend.â€? Mourinho, who confirmed he had never received an apology from Wenger after the Frenchman pushed him in the chest as they clashed on the sidelines in Octoberâ€™s meeting at Stamford Bridge, admitted his teamâ€™s approach had changed over recent months to become â€œmore strategic, less artisticâ€? as a result of suspensions and injuries to key players. Chelseaâ€™s last two victories, over Queens Park Rangers and Manchester United, were achieved with a combined three shots on target, with the leaders having been forced to adapt to life without their principal forward, Diego Costa. The striker will require a fitness test if he is to feature on Sunday after hamstring trouble, with Didier Drogba and the 17-year-old Dominic Solanke the available forward options. Mourinho offered a context to his teamâ€™s recent grind. â€œInjuries and suspensions: we lost progressively the balance of our team. We played amazingly well during the most part of the season, scoring a lot of goals and controlling games very well through the quality of our possession. In the last period we are more strategic, less artistic, because from a certain moment Diego injured or suspended; [Nemanja] Matic suspended, injured; [Cesc] FÃ bregas injured, suspended; Diego injured again. â€œWhen you lose crucial pieces, the team loses certain qualities but we are still achieving results. Itâ€™s like if you are at sea and your boat sinks, you need something to survive. A raft. In football, team spirit and team ethics, and strategy, is this. We have been top of the league since day one. We are the second team in terms of goals scored. We are the second-best team for goals conceded. The team with fewest defeats. We have some of the most spectacular team goals of the season. So, if we manage to win the league, we did everything right.â€? Mourinho will hand FÃ bregas a first appearance as a Chelsea player at the Emirates having confirmed his sales pitch to the midfielder last summer had been the opportunity â€œto win titlesâ€?. Chelsea, the Capital One Cup holders, can claim the league with four games to play by winning at Arsenal and Leicester, with the manager adamant they would be worthy champions. â€œIt would be a great achievement for us,â€? he said. â€œLooking at where Chelsea were in the last four or five years, in terms of the Premier League, it would mean a lot. We won the Champions League in the worst Premier League season Chelsea had had in the last decade, so winning the European Cup in that season was completely isolated in context. In the last few years, Chelsea were not even close to winning the title. Last season was the closest it had been for a while. Previously it had been 20 points away, or lost in November. â€œAnd, also with this situation, a team had ended because Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Michael Essien, this generation, almost all finished their career at Chelsea last summer. If we can be champions after that successful team and with people without a history of winning lots of titles â€“ young people and new people in the club â€“ that would be a great achievement. Arsenal, United and City can be champions mathematically, but we have been the best team since day one, and we want to be the best team until the last day.â€?
Title:Barnetâ€™s Martin Allen and Bristol Roversâ€™ Darrell Clarke ready for nailbiter | Paul Chronnell
Date:2015-04-24
Content:â€œYou could say itâ€™s been a bit of an on-off relationshipâ€?, says Martin Allen of his complex history with Barnet FC and the clubâ€™s chairman, Tony Kleanthous. â€œWe get on well and weâ€™ve had some great times. Sometimes he dumps me and sometimes I dump him but we always end up getting back together.â€? Barnet supporters are hoping that neither will feel the need for another dramatic parting on Saturday, when Allenâ€™s fourth spell in charge of the north London club can be crowned with the Conference title. After last Saturdayâ€™s penultimate matches, however, nobody is taking anything for granted in what has developed into a marathon tussle with Bristol Rovers for the sole automatic promotion place. Having led the division for all but a few weeks since August, Allenâ€™s side needed a late equaliser at Kidderminster and an even later Dover equaliser against Rovers, to stay on top last Saturday as both games ended 1-1. Barnetâ€™s one-point lead was preserved, they have a far better goal difference and there is only one game to go as this Saturday Barnet are at home to mid-table Gateshead and Rovers host relegation-threatened Alfreton. â€œI am a bit more used to relegation battles on the last day,â€? admits Allen, the 49-year-old former Queens Park Rangers and West Ham midfielder, who began his managerial career at Barnet in 2003 â€“ and who named his team for the decider on Thursday afternoon. â€œIâ€™ve done it with Barnet, with Brentford, with Notts County. I suppose Iâ€™m a bit of a Red Adair for saving clubs; people call me when they are in trouble.â€? Kleanthous did just that in 2011 when Allen returned for a second spell in charge to kickstart a seemingly impossible relegation escape from League Two but then left three games later to join Notts County. â€œI went for the money, for the security,â€? says Allen. â€œWith hindsight I regret it.â€? He was back at Underhill again in 2012, kept them in the league with a last-day victory over Burton but then moved on to join Gillingham, whom he led to the League Two title a year later while Barnet were slipping out of the league as well as leaving their home of more than 100 years, Underhill, under the incongruous reign of Edgar Davids. Just over a year ago, Davids departed and Allen was back in Barnetâ€™s plush new surroundings of the Hive â€“ and now the Bees are buzzing again. Rovers, however, have proved stubborn rivals. After a slow start to non-league life, an astonishing run has featured only one defeat in 28 league games stretching back to October to maintain hopes of going straight back up after the trauma of their loss of league status a year ago. Their final-day experience last May should serve as a warning to both clubs. A draw at home to Mansfield Town would have been enough to secure Roversâ€™ league status, which they had held since 1920. However, they succumbed to a desperate 1-0 defeat while their rivals Wycombe and Northampton won comfortably and the Pirates were improbably scuttled, dropping into the Conference for the first time, agonisingly on goal difference. â€œIt was a terrible day for all of us and I felt for the supporters but, to be honest, we werenâ€™t a good enough side to stay in League Two last year,â€? says the Rovers manager, 37-year-old Darrell Clarke, who had taken the reins with eight games to go. â€œWeâ€™ve turned the club on its head since then. Weâ€™ve had massive cuts to put up with after dropping out of the league; I think Iâ€™ve given 19 players their debuts this season. â€œBristol Rovers is a big club with a great history and we want to be back in the league but thereâ€™s a lot of clubs in this division who can say that. We were all down last week after letting in that late goal at Dover but weâ€™re back up for it now. If weâ€™d both won last week, weâ€™d be in the same situation as now. If itâ€™s the play-offs then itâ€™s the play-offs and we get ready for them but thereâ€™s still a chance of the title. We need to win and hope they donâ€™t. Itâ€™s Barnetâ€™s to lose but anything can happen.â€? Perhaps remembering last year, Clark is quick to dismiss the notion that a Gateshead side who ostensibly have little but pride to play for will not put up a fight and will allow Barnet an easy last-day ride to the title. â€œGateshead are a very good team with a very good manager in Gary Mills and they wonâ€™t want to end their season on a low,â€? he says. â€œAlfreton, who we play, are fighting to stay up, so of course they will give it everything. Thereâ€™s always something to play for, no teams just give up. â€œYou canâ€™t not know how Barnet are getting on. We had 2,500 telling us the score last week at Dover and thereâ€™ll be 11,500 doing it on Saturday. Of course weâ€™ll know and the players will know but we know we have to win our game to have a chance â€“ thatâ€™s all we can do. â€œWe want to give the fans a good day on Saturday. Theyâ€™ve been incredibly loyal this season, followed us everywhere and hopefully weâ€™ve given them a good season, and put a bit of pride back in the club. â€œIf we hadnâ€™t taken five points from the first five games Iâ€™d already have my flip-flops on now and weâ€™d be up but there was massive change to deal with over the summer, and we had to deal with it with a lot of new players. Whatever happens next, Iâ€™m proud of the season weâ€™ve had.â€?
